A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.\nThere is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.\nThe symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu\u2014fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.\nCorona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.\nSo, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection\u2014corona virus included. I would check that off the list.\nFirst, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.\nMost people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.\nIf you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.\nFor vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)\nAlso, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.\nIodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.\nAs I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can\u2019t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.\nThe RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.\nTo prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion.\nFinally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration\u2014drink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.\nConventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your hands\u2013I agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.\nAs for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It won\u2019t help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)\nMy last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide.

Concentrate on just the virus, and the local and global economic impact will be enormous.\"\nThat, in a nutshell, was how Rabobank saw China's \"dialectic that has no comfortable Fichtean synthesis to the thesis and antithesis\" and concluded that \"things are going to get nasty for economies and markets \u2013 especially with official WHO word that a vaccine is 18-months away.\"\nToday, two days after China officially returned to work, we got the first confirmation of just how catastrophic Beijing's order to local enterprises and businesses to rush back reboot the economy could be, when Jennifer Zeng reported that a company in Suzhou reopened, and immediately at least one CoVid2019 case found. As a result, the company's 200+ employees couldn't go home and were immediately placed under quarantine. At least the workers managed to \"organize\" quilts for themselves. Company in #Suzhou reopened. One #CoVid2019 case found. Over 200 employed couldn't go home and immediately under quarantine. They managed to organize quilts for themselves. \nThis is just the first such case. Expect many more - especially across Hubei and its neighboring provinces - as latent cases of Coronavirus which were never caught and cured spark new infections and mini epidemics, all of which dutifully captured on a smartphone clip for everyone in China to watch and freak out even more.\nWhich reminds us of another comment from Rabobank, which last week explained why the dilemma facing China is \"truly awful\":\nThe quandary for China between releasing the quarantine straitjacket in days to stop its economy from getting truly sick, and allowing a virus like this to spread further as people start to mingle again is truly awful. There are no good options. For a world with a serious lack of final end-demand, and which has been relying on China, along with increasingly \u201cChinese\u201d central banks, this is going to be a nasty shock either way that Mr Market is treating like he is Mr Magoo.\nAnd since Beijing has no way out, especially since the epidemic is still raging despite Beijing's \"doctored\", no pun intended, infection and death numbers, expect China to unleash the most draconian censorship crackdown on any reports Covid-2019 has not only not been purged but is making unwelcome appearances across China's enterprises, which will be quietly put under blanket quarantine even as Beijing pretends that all is well and its economy is once again humming on all cylinders until eventually the epidemic reaches a critical mass and China has no choice but to once again admit the full extent of the social and economic fallout. And just like in the case of SARS, don't expect such \"honesty\" to emerge for at least several weeks if not months.

The evangelical pastor Kenneth Copeland, for example, claims to have cures for Covid-19. And some Hindu nationalists in India have blamed Muslims for the country\u2019s outbreak, leading to a surge in hate crimes.\nAs these situations demonstrate, millions of people worldwide look more to religious authorities than health officials for guidance on how to behave and what to believe in a crisis.\nMy research on the intersections between public health and religion suggests enlisting religious institutions worldwide will be vital in stopping the spread of coronavirus.\nConnecting theology and health Social resistance to medical intervention often drives the transmission of infectious diseases, research shows.\nStudying the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed over 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016, I have identified important lessons\u2014both positive and negative\u2014about how religious actors can help build essential bridges between faith and science to strengthen a pandemic response.\nBridging theology and science was imperative in the Ebola outbreak, when up to 60 percent of Ebola cases were linked to funerals.\nTraditional religious burials in West Africa, both Christian and Muslim, often involve touching and washing the body, yet contact with body fluids spread Ebola.\nFor the first months of the outbreak, in early 2014, government prescriptions to cremate or swiftly bury the dead sparked fears and suspicion in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea\u2014the most affected countries.\nMany relief workers, outsiders dressed in spacesuit-like protective outfits sent in to implement these procedures in Ebola-affected communities, were blocked from entering.\nOthers faced violent, even deadly, physical attacks.\nIn late 2014, public health officials and religious leaders got together with the World Health Organization to produce a protocol for culturally sensitive burials of Ebola victims. Over 2,000 Christian and Muslim leaders were trained to conduct safe, dignified funerals in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nThe burial protocol may have saved thousands of lives, according to a 2017 study published in the journal of Neglected Tropical Diseases.\nFaith and trust Among the assets that religious actors offer is trust\u2014perhaps the most vital key in a crisis for addressing fear and misinformation.\nAfter an initial period of doubt and confusion, when many faith leaders in West Africa understood Ebola as divine punishment for various sins or simply as fate, public health officials made a concerted effort to get religious leaders to the same tables as scientists to educate and engage them on health education.\nBy late 2014, faith-inspired organizations like World Vision International were organizing workshops that taught public health practices like meticulous hygiene and quarantining of people exposed to Ebola grounded in theology and scripture.\nLike the burial protocol, such programs proved to be a crucial step in halting the spread of Ebola.\nAn equivalent intervention for Covid-19 might be a simple message focused on physical distancing, for example\u2014framed by religious leaders in terms people can understand and accept.\nBuilding bridges Any Covid-19 prevention program aimed at religious communities would have to work with faith-based organizations that know local leaders and have roots in the community.\nBut it is difficult to build partnerships between faith and health networks not accustomed to working together.\nThe Ebola outbreak demonstrated that relationships between religious and health institutions in West Africa were at best patchy.\nGovernments, international health agencies and aid groups lacked systematic knowledge about the region\u2019s diverse religious landscape, which includes Christianity, Islam and traditional African religions. And little relevant public information was available to help them learn the ropes.\nUltimately, groups of religious leaders from various faith traditions worked through interreligious councils to help coordinate national faith responses.\nOn the regional level, faith-inspired organizations like World Vision, Catholic Relief Services and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation leveraged their relationships with religious actors in West Africa to provide funding, supplies and training for Ebola relief workers.\nThe global scale of the will make it even more challenging to launch faith-inspired public health programs today.\nI am part of one such effort to begin this difficult, delicate process. On March 11, the World Faiths Development Dialogue and Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University, where I teach, joined with the Joint Learning Initiative on Faith and Local Communities to document how faith communities are responding to Covid-19.\nMy project includes a digital repository to track changes to religious gatherings, beliefs and practices during the pandemic. So far, the database shows that religious communities are responding in very different ways.\nMany Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities in the US are providing financial as well as spiritual support for not only the ill but also those who\u2019ve lost jobs because the outbreak. Global faith-based groups like Religions for Peace are teaming up to provide support for vulnerable children worldwide.\nBut other religious groups continue to spread false information to explain the disease.\nHope for the future For health officials, figuring out which religious leaders worldwide to work with, who their constituents are and how to transmit health messages that will resonate with these communities will be tricky indeed.\nBut once on board, faith leaders can do more than convey health guidance: They can bring messages of hope to communities struggling with anxiety, sadness and despair.\nOn March 27 Pope Francis, speaking alone from the Vatican to a plaza usually filled with followers, urged Catholics to approach the pandemic through faith, not fear.\n\u201cEmbracing the Lord in order to embrace hope,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the strength of faith, which frees us from fear.\u201d Katherine Marshall/The Conversation", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Why do we need"], "gensraw_title": [[5196, 467, 357, 762]], "probs_title": [[0.02042209543287754, 0.011347264982759953, 0.06170681491494179, 0.36453232169151306]]}

(Nasdaq: VIR), a clinical-stage immunology company focused on immune approaches to treating and preventing serious infectious diseases, today announced that it has identified two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d), which were originally found because they bind and neutralize the original SARS-CoV. The antibodies target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the region that the virus uses to enter cells through the cellular receptor ACE2. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes the newly named disease, Covid-19.\n\u201cWe are in the process of assessing neutralization with a pseudo-virus,\u201d said George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Vir. \u201cIn addition, we are working with international partners to assess the capacity of these antibodies to neutralize the live virus, SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\nThe company is moving ahead with research to determine if its antibodies, or additional antibodies that it may be able to identify, can be effective as treatment and/or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. To that end, the company is exploring collaborations with a number of other companies and governmental agencies. Amongst these are specific efforts at accessing manufacturing capacity globally.\n\u201cWe are pleased that, using the same platform that was used to isolate mAb114 which has proven to be active against Ebola, we have quickly identified antibodies with potential biological activity against SARS-CoV-2,\u201d said Herbert \u201cSkip\u201d Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Vir. \u201cWe are working as rapidly as possible and look forward to sharing more information as we have it.\u201d\nVir identified these antibodies from an existing library of 20 fully human antibodies that bind and neutralize related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and coronaviruses that infect animals. This library was built through a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases, including those caused by rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens.\nAntibody-based therapies are different from vaccines and have distinct attributes that may make them potentially valuable, particularly in pandemic settings:\nAntibodies can be therapeutic and prophylactic, meaning they can be used as a treatment for people who have been infected and can also protect people who have been, or may be, exposed to infection. Whereas a vaccine requires an individual to make an immune response, which can take weeks and be insufficient, an antibody provides the immune response, which can be effective within hours of injection and is not dependent upon the individual making an immune response to the pathogen. Antibodies can be engineered to have an extended half-life of several months or more. Vir is investigating other approaches to identify additional potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to testing these two antibodies, the company is also exploring the isolation of new antibodies specific for this virus using its antibody technology platform. These efforts may allow additional approaches to address this rapidly emerging public health epidemic.\nAbout Vir\u2019s Antibody Platform\nVir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola (mAb114, currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo), hepatitis B virus, influenza A, malaria, and others.\nAbout Vir Biotechnology\nVir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes. Its current development pipeline consists of five product candidates targeting hepatitis B virus, influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis.

The so-called Heat Stress Reading \u2014 that scale from 1-5 \u2014 was on 4.3 when their match started.\nMelbourne\u2019s fickle weather regularly generates news during the season\u2019s first major, but the start of the decade has brought some extremes.\nDay 11 was by far the hottest so far in a tournament. Until then, relatively mild temperatures \u2014 in terms of the Australian summer, at least \u2014 followed a few rainy days. The rain \u2014 it was dirty red one day when the wet weather pushed through a dust storm \u2014 helped alleviate the terrible air quality that affected the qualifying tournament because of smoke from devastating bush fires to the north and east of Melbourne.\nIt\u2019ll be a furnace Friday, with Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology forecasting temperatures in parts of Melbourne to hit 109 degrees F (43 degrees C) before a cooler change \u2014 possibly in time for the second men\u2019s semifinal match between Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev .\nThen the slide is expected to begin, with maximum forecast temperatures of 91 degrees C (33 degrees C) on Saturday \u2014 when Kenin and Muguruza are set to meet in the women\u2019s final \u2014 73 degrees F (23 degrees C) on Sunday for the men\u2019s final and down to 64 degrees F (18 degrees C) to start next week.\n___\nDROUGHT CONTINUES\nThe drought will extend another year for Aussies at the season-opening Grand Slam event.\nAsh Barty doesn\u2019t think hometown pressure was a factor in her semifinal loss to Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open.\nThe top-ranked Barty, who won the French Open last year after losing in the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park, had set points in both sets against the 21-year-old American, who was into the semifinals at a major for the first time.\n\u201cShe played the biggest points well,\u201d Barty said Friday. \u201cSofia came out and played aggressively on those points and deserved to win.\n\u201cI felt like I was scrapping and trying to find what I wanted to do best and came within a couple of points of winning the match. Yeah, sometimes it falls your way, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s just sport. That\u2019s life.\u201d\nBarty, holding her weeks-old niece, Olivia, on her knee, acknowledged at a news conference there had been plenty of local attention on her run, t he first by an Australian woman to the semifinals of the Australian Open since Wendy Turnbull in 1984 . There hasn\u2019t been a homegrown winner of the singles title since 1978.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a Grand Slam semifinal before. Yes, it\u2019s different at home. I enjoyed the experience,\u201d Barty said. \u201cI mean, if you would have told me three weeks ago that we would have won a tournament in Adelaide, made the semifinals of the Australian Open, I\u2019d take that absolutely every single day.\u201d\n___\nRETURNING THE FAVOR\nAll the way back when she was 7, Sofia Kenin was trying to work out ways to compete with the top players in the world.\nAfter advancing to her first Grand Slam final by beating top-ranked Ash Barty at the Australian Open, Kenin said she had been dreaming of this moment since she was a kid.\nShe made a passing reference to a video posted by Tennis Channel of her talking about how to unpick former No. 1-ranked Andy Roddick\u2019s weapon.\nIn it, a 7-year-old Kenin says the secret was in how to return his serve and explains how: \u201cIf I split, and then I turn around and hit my forehand with my short swing.\u201d\nKenin, who was born in Moscow in 1998 and moved to Florida as a baby, was a child when Roddick won the U.S. Open in 2003 . He also reached four other Grand Slam finals.\n\u201cI think everyone knows about it. I\u2019m doing an interview thing, I can return his serve, how I will return it,\u201d the 21-year-old American said. \u201cBy the way, he tweeted something about me. He said congratulations and stuff, so ... Thank you, Andy.\u201d\n___\nDJOKOVIC ON COURT\nNovak Djokovic had just reached a record eighth Australian Open final when he was asked why it seemed to be only long-retired players who were leading the campaign to have Margaret Court Arena renamed.\nIt has been a contentious issue at Melbourne Park because of Court\u2019s controversial comments on homosexuality and gay marriage. Djokovic didn\u2019t take sides.\nJohn McEnroe and Martina Navratilova this week unfurled a sign on the court asking it to be renamed in honor of Evonne Goolagong . They later apologized for breaching tournament protocol, but not for their campaign.\nDjokovic said he had seen the photo of McEnroe and Navratilova with the banner but wasn\u2019t well-enough informed about their protest to make a judgement. He also said he understood that people were hurt by comments from the 77-year-old Court, who became a religious minister after winning an all-time record 24 Grand Slam singles titles.\n\u201cMargaret is a huge champion, a tennis hero in Australia, and also around the world. One of the most important tennis players in the history of women\u2019s game,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cOf course, when she says something like that, it has a huge impact.\n\u201cI don\u2019t support ... what she said. I don\u2019t think it was the right thing to say. But she probably has her reasons and we have to respect that she has a difference in opinion.

But Barty was hardly at her best, especially at the most crucial moments, perhaps overwhelmed by the task of trying to become the first Australian woman to reach the final of the country\u2019s Grand Slam tournament since 1980.\nInstead, Kenin is the first American other than a Williams sister to reach the Australian Open final since Lindsay Davenport in 1995. And Kenin is the first American woman to beat the No. 1 player at a major since Serena topped Venus at Wimbledon in 2002.\nOn Saturday, Kenin will go up against either No. 4 Simona Halep or unseeded Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. That pair of two-time major champions and former No. 1s were to face each other in Thursday\u2019s second semifinal.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even going to look,\u201d Kenin said of the other semifinal. \u201cI\u2019m just going to relax and enjoy this moment. I\u2019m just looking forward to the final.\u201d\nIn the men\u2019s semifinals, defending champion Novak Djokovic was scheduled to play Roger Federer for the 50th time on Thursday night, with No. 5 Dominic Thiem meeting No. 7 Alexander Zverev in a matchup between 20-somethings on Friday night.\nBarty and Kenin stepped out in Rod Laver Arena in the early afternoon under a cloudless sky and a vibrant sun. The temperature topped 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in the first set, 20 to 25 (10 to 15) degrees hotter than it\u2019s been for much of a chillier-than-usual 1\u00bd weeks so far at Melbourne Park.\n\u201cIt was tough. I haven\u2019t played in this heat for two weeks (but) I expected it today,\u201d Kenin said. \u201cI\u2019m from Miami. I\u2019m used to this weather. The heat didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\nBarty braced herself by wearing an ice towel around her neck at changeovers.\nIn addition to making it uncomfortable for players and fans alike, the new conditions caused balls to zip through the air and fly off rackets, rendering it that much harder to control shots. Add that to jitters and iffy footwork at times from both women, and neither was at her best for much of the opening set.\nBarty\u2019s one-handed slice backhand was not as reliable as it normally is. Kenin\u2019s movement and groundstrokes seemed to lack their usual verve.\nIt took Kenin 43 minutes to register just one forehand winner, while 11 of her initial 14 points resulted from unforced errors by Barty.\nBarty had nearly twice as many winners in the first set, 22-12, thanks in large part to her eight aces, and she gathered more total points, too: 46-44. But that doesn\u2019t matter at all in tennis, of course.\nBarty was a point from taking that set when she went up 6-4 in the tiebreaker by slapping a 78 mph second serve with a forehand return winner, prompting Kenin to bounce her racket off the blue court and shake her head.\nMaybe that helped her release some tension, because she wouldn\u2019t lose another point in the set.\nBarty\u2019s first set point was wasted with a netted backhand, eliciting a collective \u201cA !\u201d from the seats. The second was erased when Kenin ripped a good return, followed by a forehand that wrong-footed Barty. Another winner by Kenin, this one a swinging forehand volley, put her ahead 7-6 for her first set point. Barty then missed a runaround forehand, ending the set; Kenin shouted \u201cCome on!\u201d\nNot ready to concede, Barty recovered quickly, earning the match\u2019s first break, 70 minutes in, en route to a 3-1 lead in the second set. That grew to 5-3, and she served for it at 5-4, but stumbled once more.\nKenin didn\u2019t drop another game.\nSofia Kenin of the U.S. reacts after losing a point to Australia's Ashleigh Barty during their semifinal\nSofia Kenin of the U.S. makes a forehand return to Australia's Ashleigh Barty during their semifinal\nSofia Kenin of the U.S. reacts during her semifinal\nSofia Kenin of the U.S. celebrates after defeating Australia's Ashleigh Barty in their semifina\nSofia Kenin of the U.S. throws her towel into the crowd\nSofia Kenin of the U.S. reacts as she is interviewed on court\nSupporters of Australia's Ashleigh Barty cheer her\nAustralia's Ashleigh Barty serves to Sofia Kenin\nAustralia's Ashleigh Barty cools down with an ice towel during her semifinal\nAustralian actor Rebel Wilson, center, watches the women's singles semifinal between Australia's Ashleigh Barty and Sofia Kenin\nThe Latest: Kenin tops Barty to reach Australian Open final\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Australian Open (all times local):\n4 p.m.\nSofia Kenin of the United States has reached her first Grand Slam final by upsetting No. 1 Ash Barty at the Australian Open.\nKenin saved two set points in each set en route to the 7-6 (6), 7-5 victory in the semifinals at Melbourne Park.\nThe 14th-seeded Kenin had never been past the fourth round at a major tournament until now.\nBarty was trying to become the first Australian woman to reach the final of the country\u2019s Grand Slam tournament since 1980.\nKenin will face Simona Halep or Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza on Saturday.\n___\n3:15 p.m.\nSofia Kenin saved two set points in the tiebreaker before taking the first set of the Australian Open\u2019s women\u2019s semifinal against Ash Barty 7-6 (6).\nThere were no service breaks, with 21-year-old Kenin fending off three break points in a long sixth game for an important hold as the temperature topped 38 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit) at Melbourne Park.\nThe 14th-seeded Kenin is playing in the semifinals of a major for the first time.\nTop-ranked Barty is the first Australian woman in the Australian Open semifinals since Wendy Turnbull in 1984.

Federer couldn\u2019t sustain that level. Neither his body nor Djokovic would let him.\nCasting aside a bit of a poor start during the rivals\u2019 50th meeting, Djokovic stretched his Grand Slam winning streak against Federer to six in a row with a 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-3 victory Thursday night that earned the defending champion a record eighth trip to the final at Melbourne Park.\n\u201cToday was horrible, to go through what I did. Nice entrance. Nice sendoff. And in between, it\u2019s one to forget, because you know you have a 3% chance to win,\u201d Federer said, adding that he discussed beforehand with his team how bad things would need to get for him to stop playing. \u201cOnce you can see it coming, that it\u2019s not going to work anymore, it\u2019s tough.\u201d\nDjokovic now leads their head-to-head series 27-23, including 11-6 at majors. Federer hasn\u2019t beaten him at one of the sport\u2019s four most important tournaments since 2012.\n\u201cI just want to say, respect to Roger for coming out tonight. He was obviously hurt,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cWasn\u2019t at his best.\u201d\nThe No. 2-seeded Djokovic will try to collect a record-extending eighth Australian Open title on Sunday against No. 5 Dominic Thiem or No. 7 Alexander Zverev.\nDjokovic also can claim a 17th major trophy overall to move closer to Federer\u2019s record of 20. Rafael Nadal, beaten by Thiem in the quarterfinals, is at 19.\nIn the women\u2019s final Saturday, it\u2019ll be two-time major champion Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza of Spain against 21-year-old Sofia Kenin of the United States. It\u2019s Kenin\u2019s debut in a Grand Slam title match.\nClearly, for Djokovic vs. Federer, everything hinged on the first hour or so.\nThey played on a muggy, sweltering evening, with the temperature in the high 90s (high 30s Celsius) and no breeze to offer respite.\nAlmost from the moment his wild quarterfinal ended Tuesday after he\u2019d saved seven match points and eked past Tennys Sandgren in five sets, speculation swirled about how well Federer would recover.\nMight the muscle issue force him to pull out of the tournament? Why didn\u2019t he practice Wednesday?\nAs it happens, Federer showed up, of course. And gave what he could until the end.\nHe\u2019s never handed an opponent a walkover across more than 400 Grand Slam matches, never retired from any of his more than 1,500 career tour-level matches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have gone on court if I had no chance to win,\u201d Federer said. \u201cWe saw I was still able to make a match out of it.\u201d\nIndeed, Federer appeared to be managing just fine at the outset.\nAnd, oh, did this match set out well, in terms of the atmosphere, in terms of the tension, in terms of the tennis.\nThe proceedings began with a jolt of a 14-point game as a fugue of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Roger!\u201d and \u201cNo-le! No-le!\u201d provided the soundtrack, prompting chair umpire Nico Helwerth to passively aggressively admonish spectators: \u201cPlease. Thank you.\u201d\nThere was an exchange of 17 strokes. Another of 15. There were two break points for Djokovic, nullified with the help of formidable serves. Federer took the game with three aces, three other clean winners and then broke to go up 2-0 on his way to 4-1.\nSoon it was nearly 5-1 in Federer\u2019s favor. Close doesn\u2019t count, though.\nDjokovic put up too much resistance, much like during their epic Wimbledon final last July, when he thwarted two championship points for Federer and wound up winning in a fifth-set tiebreaker.\nThis time, Djokovic said, \u201cI managed to dig my way back.\u201d\nAfter Djokovic got out of that love-40 hole to hold, he trailed 5-2 and love-30.\nBut Djokovic picked up 10 consecutive points to not only hold there but also break at love in the following game as Federer, one of the most effective servers ever, served for the set. At love! Imagine that.\nIn the eventual tiebreaker, Djokovic did what Djokovic does: No mistakes and four pure winners, including a down-the-line backhand return to end it.\nAt the break, Federer took a medical timeout and went off court with a trainer, like he did against Sandgren. Djokovic stayed on the sideline while he, too, got checked out.\nWhen play resumed, Federer did not look as spry or confident as in the first set. He tried shortcuts such as pushing forward on returns or less-than-ideal drop shots. He couldn\u2019t generate so much as one break chance.\nDjokovic took the set with a final-game break and the last two points were spectacular.\nFirst, he followed up a stinging return by heading far to his left for a sprinting, sliding, stretching cross-court backhand passing shot; he probably shouldn\u2019t even have put his racket on the ball, let alone managed to win the point.\nThen he reacted to a short shot by Federer by running all-out to flip a cross-court forehand pass that made it two sets to none. Djokovic threw an uppercut and bellowed, \u201cCome on!\u201d\nThey played for another half-hour or so but all that was left to decide was the score, not who would win.\n\u201cHe was better on the day today,\u201d Federer said, \u201cno question.\u201d\nThe Latest: Djokovic beats Federer, reaches Australian final\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Australian Open (all times local):\n10:05 p.m.\nNovak Djokovic has reached an eighth Australian Open final with a straight-set win over Roger Federer.\nThe second-seeded Djokovic maintained his record of never losing a semifinal match at Melbourne Park and is one win from extending another streak: He has won all seven finals he has played at the Australian Open.\nHe was under pressure early from six-time Australian Open champion Federer, who broke him twice in the first set but was unable to serve it out.\nDjokovic dominated the tiebreaker and went on to win the match 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-3.

It spreads through droplets from coughs and sneezes.\nFears of infection have sent people rushing to pharmacies. In Hong Kong\u2019s Kowloon district, anxious residents queued for seven hours on Thursday only to discover stores had sold out of masks.\nManufacturers have had to ramp up production, with some running factories 24 hours a day.\n\u201cWe are considering increasing shifts to two, three in order to meet demand but capacity is limited, there\u2019s only so much we can do,\u201d said an official at Kukje Pharma Co , a South Korean mask manufacturer.\nThe company has received a rush of orders for \u201ctens of millions of masks\u201d since Jan. 24, he said.\nIn China, many factories are reopening from their Lunar New Year break and calling back workers from their holidays.\nCMmask, a Chinese mask maker that supplies 30% of the domestic market , is receiving daily orders for 5 million masks, more than 10 times its usual level.\nHu Qinghui, CMmask\u2019s deputy general manager, said its stockpile of more than 10 million masks was exhausted last week. It has resumed production and called back more than 130 workers with offers to triple their wages.\n\u201cThe whole thing is so unexpected. We actually had a tough year in 2019 due to soft demand as air quality is getting better across the country,\u201d Hu said.\nHowever, just 40% of China\u2019s mask factories, which supply half of global demand, have resumed production , an industry ministry official told the state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper.\nAs the global shortage worsened, Pardam, a Czech Republic mask manufacturer, has seen orders from Asia and Europe increase sharply.\n \u201cWe are absolutely sold out,\u201d said R&D specialist Jana Ruzickova. \u201cNow we are trying our best to increase our production.\u201d\n \u201cDemand ... increased in the last four days by 57,000%. This number cannot be accommodated, even by any well-established firm in the world,\u201d said Pavel Malus from the Czech Nanotechnology Association.\nIn Turkey, Erol Memis of Era Respiratory Masks near Istanbul said the company had been working round the clock since receiving its first order from China on Thursday.\nEra had also received inquiries from Switzerland, France, Belgium, Georgia, Armenia and Egypt. \u201cIt is not possible for us to complete every request,\u201d Memis said.\nAmid heightened anxieties about the virus, retailers and authorities have sought to stop hoarding and price gouging.\nTaiwan announced a one-month ban on the export of specialist masks, while Singapore\u2019s largest supermarket chain NTUC Fairprice has limited customer purchases.\nIn China, a Beijing drugstore was fined 3 million yuan ($435,000) for hiking mask prices by almost six times.\nMeanwhile, the spike in demand has provided a massive boost for shares of mask makers, with Japan\u2019s Kawamoto Corp up nearly six-fold to a record high. In South Korea, Kukje and Monalisa Co Ltd rose 58% and 86%, respectively.\nAnti-China sentiment spreads along with coronavirus\nStanley Widianto, Khanh VU, January 30, 2020\nJAKARTA/HANOI (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online vitriol mocking the country\u2019s exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.\nThe virus, which originated in China, has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing\u2019s vast infrastructure spending and political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.\nAuthorities and schools in Toronto, Canada, were moved to warn against discrimination towards Chinese Canadians, while in Europe there was anecdotal evidence of Chinese residents facing prejudice in the street, and hostile newspaper headlines.\n\u201cOrientalist assumptions plus political distrust plus health concerns are a pretty powerful combination,\u201d said Charlotte Setijadi, and anthropologist who teaches at Singapore Management University.\nChinese authorities have said the virus emerged from a market selling illegally traded wildlife, giving rise to widespread social media mocking of China\u2019s demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine.\n\u201cStop eating bats,\u201d said one Twitter user in Thailand, the top destination for Chinese tourists. \u201cNot surprising that the Chinese are making new diseases,\u201d another Thai user posted alongside a video clip that showed a man eating raw meat.\n\u201cBecause your country is beginning (to) spread disease...we do not accept to serve the guest from China,\u201d read a sign in English outside the Danang Riverside hotel in the central Vietnamese city of the same name. Authorities later told the hotel to remove the sign, its manager said in a Facebook post.\n", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Australian fans, quite"], "gensraw_title": [[38037, 3297, 12, 2408]], "probs_title": [[0.05960473045706749, 0.14470495283603668, 0.1361602395772934, 0.0002957931428682059]]}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] 2. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) 3. 2019-nCoV: The virus is 75 to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV\nPathogenesis\nPeople infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.\nIt has high mortality\nIn the current situation the mortality rate is 3%. The severity of illness is concerning: almost a third of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care; six patients died; five had acute cardiac injury; and four required ventilation.\nIts Zoonotic\nIt is closely related to several bat coronaviruses. Bats are the primary reservoir for the virus. SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in wet markets, whereas MERS-CoV is transmitted from camels to humans. In both cases, the ancestral hosts were probably bats.\nIt is more infectious to humans\nNotably, 2019-nCoV grows better in primary human airway epithelial cells than in standard tissue-culture cells, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It is likely that 2019-nCoV will behave more like SARS-CoV.\nHuman to Human infection is weak\nBoth SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways. Consequently, transmission occurs primarily from patients with recognized illness and not from patients with mild, nonspecific signs.\nIt appears that 2019-nCoV uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]), so transmission is expected only after signs of lower respiratory tract disease develop.\nThe median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7\u00b70 days (4\u00b70\u20138\u00b70), to shortness of breath was 8\u00b70 days (5\u00b70\u201313\u00b70), to ARDS was 9\u00b70 days (8\u00b70\u201314\u00b70), to mechanical ventilation was 10\u00b75 days (7\u00b70\u201314\u00b70), and to ICU admission was 10\u00b75 days.\nIts unlikely tp spread by eating sea food in India It has been traced to snakes in China so unlikely to spread in India by eating sea food. Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species -- bats -- to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.\nFlight Transmission\nTransmission of foodborne diseases on aircraft, including cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis, and staphylococcal food poisoning, have been well documented. Transmission of smallpox on aircraft was reported in 1965. An outbreak of influenza occurred in 1979 among passengers on a flight that had a three hours\u2019 ground delay before takeoff. The influenza attack rate among the passengers was very high (72 %), and was attributed to the ventilation system not operating during the ground delay. Epidemiological investigations have also indicated that measles may have been transmitted aboard international flights. To date, no case of active TB has been identified as a result of exposure while on a commercial aircraft. However, there is some evidence that transmission of M. tuberculosis may occur during long (i.e. more than eight hours) flights, from an infectious source (a passenger or crew member) to other passengers or crew members.\n It\u2019s a large droplet infection\nTransmission of 2019-nCoV probably occurs by means of large droplets and contact and less so by means of aerosols and fomites, on the basis of experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\nUniversal droplets precautions the answer\n1. Quarantining for two weeks of the LRTI patient 2. Timely diagnosis 3. Strict adherence to universal precautions\nIts all over\nAustralia (4), Macau (1), Hong Kong ( 5), France(3), Japan (3), Malaysia (4), Nepal (1), Singapore (3), Taiwan (3), South Korea (3), Thailand (5), United states (3), Vietnam (2),\nIs it a public health emergency\nThere is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency.\nPMO Suggestions Sent\n17 th Jan: India at threat of Corona.

And honestly, if people are truly that gullible and stupid that they will fall for the crap they are pushing, then there is NO hope for them at all!\nIn fact, I was surfing the internet since yesterday looking for some REAL TRUTHS about this \"Corona Virus\" hysteria, and I found some most interesting reports from Jim Stone's website at www.jimstone.is that I absolutely want to share with my readers.... In fact, the first part that I want to present here blows the Jew spew media lies where they are supposedly showing \"pictures\" from Wuhan China concerning this \"epidemic\" to heck... Here is that article here:\nB M: I just figured out how to prove much of the pandemic story line fake If all the videos posted online to Twitter about people laying dead in the streets are real, why are a majority of them shot during the summer, with lush green leaves on the trees? China's trees don't have any leaves now. It is winter there. That means the videos are random, and no leaves on the trees does nothing to confirm the videos really are of a pandemic.\nHERE WE GO! SOME, IF NOT ALL PANDEMIC RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS \"FROM CHINA\" ARE PROVEN FAKE\nBUSTED!!! . . . . . sometimes a \"day at work\" ends quite nicely. LOOK PEOPLE, the elite are NOT going to release a disease they can be killed by, the \"disease\" will be in the shot.\nOK, I too looked at those pictures, and I thought there was something very ODD about them... Jim has hit the 'nail on the head' by showing that they could NOT have been taken recently from Wuhan as the LEAVES ON THE TREES are still there in plain sight meaning that they were actually taken MONTHS ago and well before this supposed \"outbreak\"!\nWhat we have here is therefore definitive proof that the criminals in charge are absolutely using this \"Corona Virus outbreak\" for their criminal agenda of pushing their insidious \"vaccines\" on all of us once more!\nI absolutely will continue to show the evidence here that this may indeed be all a scam to get gullible people to panic and line up like dumb ass sheep to be injected by their poisonous vaccines.... So stay tuned everyone, for there is...\nMore to come\nNTS\n*Update, January 24th, 2020: Apparently I have had a few 'critics' come in and try to ruin my comment section by claiming that I do not know \"what the fuck I am talking about\" and that Wuhan, China probably does not even get snow this time of year...

(He's doing fine now.) And today I learned that the plane with US citizens being evacuated from Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, stopped in Anchorage on the way to their destination in California. These two bits of information don't cause me to worry or run out and buy a face mask, but they do highlight that in today's world we aren't as far away from things as we sometimes think. And if we consider that the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919, it seems to have spread around the world in an era when airplanes were small and transoceanic passengers went by ship. At the moment, we know little about this illness. Here's what the CDC (US Center for Disease Control) says about risk assessment: \"Risk Assessment Outbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including whether and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). This is a serious public health threat. The fact that this virus has caused severe illness and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning, but it\u2019s unclear how the situation in the United States will unfold at this time. The risk to individuals is dependent on exposure. At this time, some people will have an increased risk of infection, for example healthcare workers caring for 2019-nCoV patients and other close contacts. For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV is considered low.\" (emphasis added) The CDC site gives a lot more information you might find interesting, such as: \"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS and SARS. CDC and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are continuing to conduct enhanced entry screening of passengers who have been in Wuhan within the past 14 days at 5 designated U.S. airports. Given travel out of Wuhan has been shut down, the number of passengers who meet this criteria are dwindling.

The question is, how to better protect our selves and our loved ones from possible infection? The answer or I should say part of the solution is in washing hands often, The CDC recommends washing hands often in order to reduce the risk of infection. Think about how many things we touch in a single day. The gas pump and the credit card machines, the elevator buttons, all of the buttons at the self checkout at the grocery store. The grocery cart, door handles, faucets, our cell phones, computer keys, handles, money, we touch and handle things in the store all the time. The list goes on and on and we don\u2019t even think about the fact that infection is easily spread this way.\nChaplain Paul was also quoted saying, If you or someone in your family is dealing with the flu then it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have that person wear a surgical mask and gloves. This helps to reduce the spread of infection in hospitals. If you or some one in your family works in a nursing home or hospital setting then have them remove their shoes when they return home. Use bleach wipes to disinfect shoes. Wipe down all can goods, bottles and containers before bringing them into your home.\nChaplain Paul was also quoted saying, wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands often, as a Community Chaplain I see all to often how easy infection spreads in a hospital setting. Remember try not to cough or sneeze into your hands, stay home if you are sick. Do not visit anyone in a hospital or nursing home setting if you are sick or even have a cold. Above all pray for God\u2019s guidance, protection and love in these matters and remember what proverbs 3:5-6 teaches, Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths\u2026Amen\u201d\nLaTribuna Christian Publishing supports educating the public on how infection spreads and how we as a nation can best prevent the spreading of infection.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["How to Prevent Viruses In Healthcare"], "gensraw_title": [[2438, 285, 31573, 16311, 2665, 555, 30290, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.23760226368904114, 0.622800350189209, 0.08496470004320145, 0.007867136038839817, 0.9129799008369446, 0.040593378245830536, 0.46909603476524353, 0.6804211139678955]]}

If my articles are boring to you, it may be that you need to read more of them, as was suggested by John Cage, \u201cIf something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.\u201d\nIn the three great monotheistic religions, Islam, Christianity and Judaism, God is viewed as a supreme, transcendent being, beyond matter space and time, and yet the foundation of all that meets our senses that is described in terms of matter, space, and time. That is the Al Batin or the Hidden God of monotheism. Furthermore, this God is not the god of deism, who created the world and then left it alone, or the god of pantheism, who is equated with all of existence. The Islamic and the Judeo-Christian God is a nanosecond-by-nanosecond participant in each event that takes place in every cubic nanometer of the universe. He has full knowledge of all things. God listens to every thought and participates in each action of his very special creation, a minute bit of organized matter called humanity that moves around on the surface of a tiny pebble in a vast universe. The Holy Quran declares:\nAllah\u2019s is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah are all affairs returned for final judgment. (Al Quran 57:6)\nWhereas the nineteenth century physics was about to frame God out of physical understanding of the universe, the twentieth century physics has turned the tables in favor of Monotheism.\nTo the atheists design in the universe is apparent but not real. For the theists, enlightened in science, the converse is true, the self sufficiency of the universe based on the laws of nature is apparent and perceived only and is not real. God is the Law Giver and sustainer of the universe. Both positions may be argued to some degree from modern science. However, only theism can offer a holistic approach, not only explaining our universe, but also human morality and ethics, our history and personal experience.\nWhen we approach science from this theistic perspective we find that our religion and science become one and our psyche finds unification.\nIf there is a \u2018Personal God\u2019 that hears human prayers then there has to be a way for the deity to influence the physical world without breaking the laws of nature and making the study of science futile. Quantum physics may be the magical wand, whereby Personal God can influence our world, without breaking the laws of nature.

(Gaithersburg, MD, USA) whereby Emergent will deploy its contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services to support the manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s lead vaccine candidate for COVID-19 that leverages the AdVac and PER.C6 technologies from the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. Under the agreement, Emergent will provide drug substance manufacturing services with its molecule-to-market CDMO offering, supported by investments from Johnson & Johnson beginning in 2020, and will reserve certain large-scale manufacturing capacity to pave the way for commercial manufacturing of Janssen\u2019s adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine beginning in 2021. To support Johnson & Johnson\u2019s goal of supplying one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, a long-term commercial manufacturing agreement is under negotiation for large-scale drug substance manufacturing anticipated to begin in 2021. Large-scale manufacturing of drug substance for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine candidate will be done at Emergent\u2019s Baltimore Bayview facility, a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) designed for rapid manufacturing of vaccines and treatments in large quantities during public health emergencies. Emergent\u2019s CIADM is a result of a public-private partnership with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Emergent\u2019s Bayview facility has unique capabilities across four independent suites to produce at clinical scale to get candidates rapidly into the clinic, while at the same time scaling up to enable large-scale manufacturing to up to 4000L to prepare for production of commercial volumes to meet customer demand. The CIADM has the capacity to produce tens to hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine on an annual basis, based upon the platform technology being used. Additionally, Emergent had earlier entered into a formal partnership with the US government to expedite development of a plasma-derived therapy for patients with COVID-19. Emergent has received USD 14.5 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the HHS, in support of its COVID-HIG program, one of two hyperimmune development programs announced by Emergent in March. COVID-HIG is a candidate human hyperimmune product being developed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in severe hospitalized patients and high-risk, acute symptomatic patients to prevent progression to severe symptoms. COVID-HIG will be manufactured using plasma donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19 with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. \u201cWhen mission-driven organizations combine talents and capabilities, potential solutions to serious issues like COVID-19 become more within reach to benefit patients. We are proud of our collaboration with Johnson & Johnson and are equally committed to our longstanding relationship with the US government,\u201d said Robert G. Kramer Sr., president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions. \u201cAt a time like this, we all need to be working together to achieve maximum results for public health. Emergent is committed to our mission \u2013 to protect and enhance life \u2013 by advancing our own therapies and helping partner companies advance their programs as well.\u201d \u201cWe share with our partners the same urgency to combat COVID-19 and will leverage our talents, capabilities, and capacities up to 300 million doses to advance this much-needed vaccine candidate and ensure ongoing commercial supply through our CDMO services,\u201d said Syed T.

Brands That Got Hit Hard In The Virus Name Game", "text": "What's in a name?' Juliet once asked. It's not a question one would want to ask brands today probably because it'll conjure up the horrors that come from first naming a product, and then changing it because it just so happens there's a deadly virus with the same name doing the rounds .\nThat's some semantics hell right there.\nThe process is apparently as expensive as it is painful. Think millions lost in rebranding. The Guardian referring to a study wrote whenever a brand takes on the daunting task, sales take a hit by at least 5 per cent to 20 per cent. So as you can imagine, this not something that brands do on a whim. It's only when the name gets associated with something utterly disastrous that steps have to be taken.\nWhile there have been brands that could spin the situation to their benefit, there are some that couldn't recover. While we're not deciding their fate, we are listing some brands here that made it to the red zone. 1. Coronavirus versus Corona beer.\nThis is as stupid as it is legit. People have been reportedly sweating it out on their keyboards searching for ' Corona beer virus .' It's hard to ignore the similarity in the two names, but it's stupid to believe they're the same. Corona beer, a pale ale, is what comes in a long-necked bottle with a lemon slice that does nothing. Coronavirus , on the other hand, is a novel virus (2019-nCoV) that leaves you with pneumonia-like symptoms. You have trouble breathing and may even suffer from fever, cold and cough. No, it did not take its name from the beer. Corona is Latin for 'crown.' The virus gets its name from the crown-like structure it bears, as seen under a microscope.

Zica hatchback versus Zika virus.\nIt was in 2016 that Tata Motors announced it's decision to rename its then-not-yet-launched hatchback, Zica. The Zika health crisis had already rocked the boat by that time. Around this time It wasn't until September 2018 that Tiago was finally launched in India. Zica was meant to be short for 'Zippy car,' one reports points out. What it ended up being similar in name to was a mosquito-borne virus that was reportedly causing birth defects in Brazil, having affected close to a million people by 2015. 3. ISIS versus Isis chocolate. ISIS chocolates\nFirst off, Isis was the Egyptian goddess of fertility, motherhood, magic and death. According to Egyptian theology, she took care of women and the sick. Isis chocolate came from a Belgium chocolate company founded in 1923. It was originally named 'Italo Suisse' but later changed its name to Isis in 2013, an unfortunate move considering ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), the terrorist group was born. It grew and spread in Syria and Iraq, and made headlines after the alleged beheadings of US and UK citizens. 4. Ayds diet candy versus AIDS.\nThe Campana Company Ayds diet candy enjoyed its time in the sun in the 1970s and early 1980s. 'Ayds Reducing Plan vitamin and mineral Candy' later, 'appetite suppressant candy' came in a slew of flavours. But a growing awareness of AIDS by the mid-'80s made people lose any craving for Ayds candy. Even a name change to diet Ayds didn't have the intended effect. The company held on to the illusion that everything was fine. In 1983, Time Magazine reported that retailers were in fact saying \"The disease is not hurting the product... Ayds sales have never been better.\" That wasn't the case though. In 1988, AP put out a story confirming the sales of this candy were down by 50 per cent. The product was soon taken off the market. 5. Sars, the Taiwanese soft drink, versus SARS, the acute respiratory syndrome.\nIn the 1940s, a company called Hey Song Company created a drink called sars that borrowed its name from its main ingredient sarsaparilla (also sarsi). A famous drink in southeast Asian countries, most believe it helps the body cool down and even helps it recover from sore throats, reports a dated AP article. That said, Hey Song's spokeswoman Chou Shiao-ping told AP that consumers did apparently feel uneasy given its name, \"But most people know you won't get SARS simply by drinking Sars.\" So, a raised eyebrow (if you're hearing the name for the first time) aside, Sars is doing pretty well for itself. SARS, the fatal respiratory illness meanwhile, is said to have claimed 200 lives in Hong Kong and China leaving close to 4,000 sick. The soft drink came close to getting destroyed by a disease but seems to have emerged a winner.

First, they are conspiracy theorists par excellence. This first observation should not be surprising given that antivaccine views are strongly grounded in particularly what I like to call the central conspiracy theory of the antivaccine movement, namely that \u201cthey\u201d (the CDC, big pharma, doctors, etc.) \u201cknow\u201d that vaccines cause autism and all the adverse health effects falsely attributed to them by antivaxxers but are covering up the studies and data showing that. I\u2019ve been writing about this aspect of antivaxxers for as long as I\u2019ve been blogging, beginning the Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u2019s conspiratorial take on the CDC Simpsonwood conference and more recently with Del Bigtree\u2019s cherry-picking of quotes from the World Health Organization Vaccine Safety Summit a couple of months ago. Second, to antivaxxers, it\u2019s always, always , always the vaccines. A recent example occurred when antivaxxers tried to blame the vaccine strain of measles for the deadly measles outbreak in Samoa late last year. Now, with the recent outbreak of serious coronavirus disease that started in Wuhan, China, antivaxxers are looking for another way to blame vaccines. Yesterday, they blamed the flu vaccine and viral interference. Today, former scientist turned antivaccine \u201cscientist\u201d James Lyons-Weiler is claiming that 2019-nCoV, the coronavirus strain behind the outbreak, is in reality the result of an attempt to make a vaccine that went wrong.\nBecause, of course, it\u2019s always vaccines. Always. At least he could have been a bit more original, but originality is foreign to antivaxxers. Their conspiracy theories always involve harm caused by vaccines; so whenever there is an outbreak of a new disease you can always count on them somehow finding a way to blame vaccines, be they existing vaccines like the influenza vaccine or experimental vaccines, like the supposed coronavirus vaccine.\nConspiracy theorists generally don\u2019t want to be perceived as conspiracy theorists; so they often go to great lengths to convince you that their conspiracy theory is reasonable. One strategy they employ to achieve that is to consider, seemingly very carefully, alternate explanations for the phenomenon being \u201cexplained\u201d by their conspiracy theory. Lyons-Weiler does exactly that in his post, examining four different \u201cexplanations\u201d for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus outbreak: Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a recombined virus. A recombined virus that naturally picked up a SARS-like spike protein in it N-terminus (3\u2032 end) of the viral genome. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a bioweapon. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a vaccine.\nLike any good conspiracy theorist, he examines each \u201chypothesis\u201d in turn and then\u2014surprise! surprise!\u2014concludes that his hypothesis conspiracy theory is the most likely to be true. Let\u2019s start with #1 (Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a Recombined Virus.) Lyons-Weiler begins by citing a Lancet paper hot off the presses yesterday on the nucleotide sequence of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In it, the authors reported the results of next generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, obtaining complete and partial 2019-nCoV sequences. They then did phylogenetic analysis, comparing the 2019-nCoV sequence to those of other coronaviruses in order to examine the evolutionary history of the virus and try to infer its likely origin.\nTheir findings:\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\u00b798% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\nAnd conclusions:\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\nTranslation: This virus probably originated in bats, but investigators can\u2019t rule out its going through an intermediary, such as an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan where the outbreak originated and a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak. The authors noted that the genome \u201csequences of 2019-nCoV sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical, which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly.\u201d\nSo there is an inserted sequence that is different from the bat strains examined. Lyons-Weiler beliefs it came from a DNA vector pShuttle-SN, that was used in China in the 1980s to create a more immunogenic coronavirus. Let\u2019s just say that he doesn\u2019t make his case very well, but let\u2019s take a look. First, he dismisses explanation #1 thusly:\nOption 1. Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a Recombined Virus.\nEvidence for: Phylogenetic clustering with Bat coronaviruses.\nEvidence against: Low bootstrap support (N=75) and presence of a INS1378.\nStatus: Falsified hypothesis . Test: Survey coronviruses in animals in the wild.\nLyons-Weiler might be correct here in that there probably to be some sort of evolutionary or recombination event resulting in the seemingly inserted sequence, but I wouldn\u2019t call the hypothesis \u201cfalsified.\u201d He\u2019s leaping to that conclusion because he wants to blame a vaccine.\nNext up:\nOption 2. A recombined virus that naturally picked up a SARS-like spike protein in it N-terminus (3\u2032 end) of the viral genome.\nEvidence for: The INS1378 codon bias similar to snakes ($)\nEvidence against: Insufficient match in database search to other known CoV spike proteins (Ji et al., 2020)\nStatus: Speculative hypothesis. Unlikely.\nTest: Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will confirm).\nWhat is \u201ccodon bias\u201d? First, let\u2019s explain what a codon is. A codon is the three nucleotide sequence that specifies a single amino acid in the protein that is encoded by a given gene. Because there are more three nucleotide combinations than there are amino acids (64 different codons\u201461 if you remove the stop codons that tell the ribosomes to stop making protein\u2014versus only 20 amino acids used to make proteins), the genetic code is said to be \u201cdegenerate,\u201d meaning that multiple codon sequences can encode a single amino acid, as this chart shows:\nNote that \u201cU\u201d is uracil, which is what RNA uses instead of \u201cT\u201d or thymidine, which is what DNA uses. Basically, in terms of the genetic code, functionally U = T. Codon usage bias is a term that refers to a bias in which codons are used to specify a given amino acid. When multiple codons can encode a given amino acid in a protein, organisms have a bias in which codon(s) are used to encode that amino acid. In other words, the codons used to specify a given amino acid are not used randomly. Some are used more frequently than others, hence the term \u201ccodon bias\u201d or \u201ccodon usage bias.\u201d\nWhat Lyons-Weiler is referring to is this paper, which claims that there was a coding bias consistent with snakes. Lyons-Weiler is also correct that this particular paper is not very good and makes an extrapolation that\u2019s difficult to justify.\nAs noted in this WIRED story :\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete garbage,\u201d says Edward Holmes, a zoologist at the University of Sydney\u2019s Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, who specializes in emerging RNA viruses, a class that includes coronaviruses like 2019-nCoV. Holmes, who also holds appointments at the Chinese CDC and Fudan University in Shanghai, is among a number of scientists who are pointing out\u2014in virology forums, science Slacks, and on Twitter\u2014what they deem to be major flaws in the paper, and calling on the journal to have it retracted. \u201cIt\u2019s great that viral sequence data is getting shared openly in real time,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cThe downside is then you get people using that data to make conclusions they really shouldn\u2019t. The result is just a really unhelpful distraction that smacks of opportunism.\u201d\nAnd:\nBut Holmes says that this approach has a number of issues. For one thing, comparing codon bias is a very indirect way of identifying an animal host. For another, it works best when looking at species from wildly different corners of the taxonomical hierarchy. Plant and mammal viruses have really distinct codon patterns. So do insect and bird viruses. But within more closely related groups, it\u2019s much harder to tease apart meaningful patterns\u2014especially when the authors only sampled a few species. \u201cThere could easily be other species out there that are more similar than snakes, but we don\u2019t know because they just haven\u2019t been put in the analysis,\u201d says Holmes. He and others are also skeptical that snakes could be the intermediate host, because there aren\u2019t any documented cases of reptiles hosting coronaviruses that can transmit to humans. Their cold-blooded biology is just too different. 2019-nCoV, and its closest relative, SARS, belong to a subgroup known as beta-coronaviruses, which are only known to infect mammals.\nHere\u2019s the trick, though. Lyons-Weiler dismisses the possibility that 2019-nCoV somehow picked up a SARS-like sequence naturally based on a paper that made unjustified extrapolations and assumptions, presenting that paper as though it\u2019s the only evidence for this. In fact, he hasn\u2019t ruled out a recombination event with another, unknown coronavirus. As he himself pointed out, RNA viruses mutate rather rapidly.\nRegarding option #3 (that 2019-nCoV was a bioweapon), the less said, the better. There is a BSL-4 (highest biosafety level) lab 20 miles from the Wuhan market, and, of course, whenever there\u2019s a new outbreak one of the standard conspiracy theories that always\u2014and I do mean always \u2014crops up is that the organism causing the outbreak is a bioweapon that got loose. Personally, the version of this conspiracy theory that most amuses me is that 2019-nCoV is a weaponized coronavirus made in Canada and stolen by Chinese agents. Canada? Making bioweapons? Seriously?\nOf course, the main reason Lyons-Weiler rejects the bioweapon conspiracy theory is because he wants to push the \u201cvaccine strain\u201d conspiracy theory instead:\nIPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378. Here\u2019s a shot of the alignment and the DOT Plot. Here\u2019s the nucleotide sequence at NCBI\u2019s Nucleotide database. Here\u2019s a patent for its use in recombination virology. The pShuttle-SN vector was among many described in a 1998 paper by Bert Vogelstein et al; here is a company where one can purchase the pShuttle-SN vector.\nBefore I go any further, I did some BLAST searches for the \u201cINS1378\u201d sequence helpfully provided by Lyons-Weiler. Here is the result.\nNot surprisingly, it\u2019s all sequences related to the Wuhan market outbreak, although there is one segment that closely resembles (78% identity) the bat sequence:\nI recognized the sort of analysis that Lyons-Weiler had done; so I decided to try to replicate it by aligning the \u201cINS1378\u201d sequence with the pShuttle-SN sequence using the BLAST tool. My analysis found a sequence 1,182 nucleotides long with 68% identity (which, let me tell you, is not very high, particularly with all the gaps). Here\u2019s part of it:\nThis is pretty good alignment, but certainly nowhere near slam dunk evidence for the origin of 2019-nCoV being pShuttle-SN, especially when it\u2019s almost certainly more likely that this sequence could have arisen naturally. After all, remember that, although this vector was apparently used by the Chinese to try to make coronavirus variant that was more immunogenic for use in a vaccine, the vector itself is just a plasmid (DNA in a circle) into which you can insert various DNA sequences to replicate and to drive expression. This particular vector was designed for use in generating adenovirus vectors. To that end, it has a bunch of restriction enzyme sites that can be used to insert DNA sequences. One version of the vector has a CMV promoter to drive expression of whatever cDNA sequence is placed into the vector. However, the sequence that matches (nucleotides 1214-2356) doesn\u2019t code for any protein. It just happens to be a 68% match. If the sequence came from the vector, there should be large swaths of 100% match. As an actual expert pointed out on Twitter, the match should be close to 100% for the entire sequence: I looked at that alignment \u2013 the two aligned sequences are distantly related, but this would argue against his claim. If the insert came from a commercial vector, it would be near-identical. He doesn't seem to know what he's talking about, but he knows just enough to fake it \u2014 Steven Salzberg (@StevenSalzberg1) January 31, 2020\nI\u2019m starting to think I know why Lyons-Weiler no longer runs a bioinformatics core.\nLyons-Weiler then makes another leap of \u201clogic\u201d:\nThe very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials;\n\u201cAn early concern for application of a SARS-CoV vaccine was the experience with other coronavirus infections which induced enhanced disease and immunopathology in animals when challenged with infectious virus [31], a concern reinforced by the report that animals given an alum adjuvanted SARS vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV exhibited an immunopathologic lung reaction reminiscent of that described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and in animal models given RSV vaccine and challenged naturally (infants) or artificially (animals) with RSV [32], [33]. We and others described a similar immunopathologic reaction in mice vaccinated with a SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [18], [20], [21], [28]. It has been proposed that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is the antigen to which the immunopathologic reaction is directed [18], [21]. Thus, concern for proceeding to humans with candidate SARS-CoV vaccines emerged from these various observations.\u201d \u2013 Tseng et al.,\nThe disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.\nThis doesn\u2019t even make sense. Yes, in animal models, animals vaccinated with a SARS vaccine then challenged with the SARS coronavirus developed severe disease due to an excessive immune reaction to the virus primed by the vaccine. That is indeed a reason to be very cautious moving to clinical trials of vaccines against SARS, MERS, or 2019-nCoV. It is quite a stretch to think that this observation strongly suggests that 2019-nCoV is likely to have come from a strain made in order to produce a coronavirus vaccine. Even Lyons-Weiler seems to realize this:\nThe disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.\nEvidence for: Sequence homology between INS1378 to pShuttle Coronavirus vaccine; presence of a SARS-like Spike protein in bat coronavirus, otherwise most similar to bat coronaviruses; low bootstrap value.\nEvidence against: Low sequence homology (but highly signifiant). NB these viruses are RNA viruses and they can evolve quickly, even under laboratory conditions.\nStatus: Most likely.\nTest: Determine the nucleotide sequence all laboratory types of coronavirus being studied in China (a match will confirm). Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will falsify).\nSeriously. Lyons-Weiler used to do genomics for a living before he turned to pseudoscience. Surely, at some level deep down, he must know what thin gruel this is. In fact, he inadvertently signals that he knows by following up \u201clow sequence homology\u201d with \u201cbut highly significant.\u201d Then he concludes that his idea is \u201cmost likely\u201d immediately after having dismissed the conspiracy theory that 2019-nCoV is an escaped bioweapon.\nLet\u2019s just put it this way. It\u2019s highly unlikely that sequence from pShuttle, which does not code for any protein, inserted into a coronavirus could evolve into a sequence that encodes a virulent SARS-like peptide sequence, particularly given all the gaps in alignment between the two sequences. Far more likely, it would result in a coronavirus that couldn\u2019t infect anything because one of its key proteins would be truncated due to a random stop codon. It\u2019s also a nifty trick he pulled. Notice how he implies that the alignment he did was with the Chinese pShuttle containing the actual SARS sequence when in fact it was with just the shuttle vector itself (Genbank accession no. AY862402) without any inserted viral sequences.\nNone of this stops him from fear mongering about 2019-nCoV:\nThe implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.\nIn the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. With an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from China to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.\nYes, Lyons-Weiler is actually suggesting that the Chinese sensitized their population with a SARS vaccine and that the vaccine strain of virus escaped from the lab. He soon realizes that that possibility would mean that this outbreak would likely be short and quickly contained, as there is no evidence that China ever conducted a mass vaccination program against SARS. There is, after all, as yet no approved vaccine for SARS . So he has to add that bit about the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d in which 2019-nCoV is more contagious and lethal. The problem is that we already know that it\u2019s definitely not more lethal than MERS (not even close, given that MERS is 34% fatal) and likely not more lethal than SARS. He\u2019s just pulling these speculations out of his nether regions. Whatever the origin of 2019-nCoV, Institut Pasteur has not only isolated and sequenced the responsible strain, but figured out how to grow large amounts of it in culture , paving the way to studies to determine the mechanism for its pathogenicity and to develop an effective vaccine.\nJames Lyons-Weiler\u2019s speculations and fear mongering just go to show how even a scientist can fall under the spell of antivaccine pseudoscience (or any other conspiracy theory-driven pseudoscience). My guess is that the Lyons-Weiler who once ran a genomics core would have recognized that the \u201cscience\u201d that the antivaccine Lyons-Weiler of today is laying down is nothing more than wild speculation that\u2019s based on only the thinnest of scientific gruel and highly unlikely to be true. More\u2019s the pity. Even worse, because he has a background in molecular biology, his conspiracy theory will sound plausible to most lay people.

How can we be certain that bad days lie ahead?\nThe Baltic Dry Index In the light of the Coronavirus, which is spreading with no end in sight, more people are feeling compelled to ask the question, will the global economy fail? Some are predicting that the global economy, including the US economy will fail due to the introduction of new factors such as the Coronavirus. How will we be able to tell if this happening?\nBefore the introduction of the Coronavirus, the global economy was already in deep trouble. What people should know is that back in December of 2019, before the Coronavirus went active, the global economy was on the verge of collapse. How do we know? We know because of what the Baltic Dry Index was doing. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange. It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials, such as coal and steel. In short, the BDI is one of the best indicators on how the global economy is performing. The fact that the Baltic Dry Index focuses on raw materials is important because demand for raw materials provides a glimpse into the future. In short, the DBI tells economists and governmental leaders how the global economy is doing at a given point in time as well as provides a means to predict future economic trends much like the futures market.\nBefore the introduction of the Coronavirus, Chinese-American trade tensions had already been contributing to a plummeting BDI, which would indicate that the global economy is in trouble and certainly the American economy would follow suit. In December, analysts were already associating the relentless slide of the BDI with an end to front-loading, triggering by easing of US-China trade tensions due to the new trade agreement signed by both side. The two sides signed the phase-one trade deal, which had been doing the rounds since the beginning of the final quarter of 2019.\nBefore the trade deal was signed, the BDI had already plummeted by a staggering 78%!

The chance that the virus can still be contained in China is still there, but it is getting smaller every day. Some researchers believe that we are already in the early stages of a pandemic, such as Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London.\nCharit\u00e9 virologist Christian Drosten also says that one has to be prepared for a pandemic. But what does that mean? What would it look like if the virus spreads further in Germany?\nPandemic sounds like death and destruction. After the Spanish flu, for example, the 1918 probably more than 50 millions of people fell victim. But not every pandemic is so devastating. If the new virus spreads in Germany, this could also become noticeable as a flu wave, which is a cold for most and only becomes life-threatening for some.\nIf a Covid \u2013 19 \u2013 If a pandemic should come, the country is currently most likely to be suffering from a severe flu outbreak, said the President of Robert Koch Institutes, Lothar Wieler, on Thursday evening in Berlin. And for this scenario, there is a lot that speaks so far about Sars-CoV-2. From throat to throat\nThe most important point is that the virus can obviously reproduce quite well in the throat. \u201cThis is a big difference to Sars,\u201d Drosten also said on Thursday. Initially, because of the similarity of the new corona virus to the Sars pathogen, researchers had assumed that the new virus would also multiply, especially in the deeper airways. This is because there are important binding sites that apparently use both the Sars corona virus and Sars CoV-2 to slip into the cells. Christian Drosten, Director of the Virology Institute at the Berlin Charit\u00e9. Photo: Britta Pedersen / dpa \u201cA virus like this has to be inhaled into the lungs, and that's a long way to go,\u201d said Drosten. With influenza, however, the virus multiplies in the throat. Researchers believe that is precisely why the flu is spread so easily. Because the way from throat to throat is not as far as from lungs to lungs.\n\u201cBased on initial patient observations, we now suspect that the novel coronavirus is also multiplying in the throat, as is the case with influenza.\u201d said Drosten. Even in early infected patients, the virus can regularly be isolated from throat swabs in the laboratory. An important key figure is still missing There is yet another point that the virus could trigger a flu-like pandemic: the mortality from the pathogen. According to Drosten, data outside of China indicated that the chances of dying from the viral disease were in the 0.2 percent range. This is similar to the typical influenza pandemics of 1957 or 1968. Even if the information is still \u201cvery woodcut-like\u201d, it is an overall picture, \u201cwhich now indicates a course similar to a flu pandemic, even if it becomes a pandemic.\u201d\nTo find out how quickly the virus can spread, however, scientists need further information from China \u2013 for example the \u201cattack rate\u201d. This epidemiological figure shows how many of the people who can be infected have actually been infected. It is also used to predict the number of victims from an epidemic. This helps to provide resources for medical care and to produce vaccines and medicines.\nDrosten hopes that this measure will soon be derived from the outbreaks outside of China. One communicates intensively with these countries, said RKI boss Wieler. China itself is \u201cextremely challenged with this huge outbreak and is certainly not in a position to deliver all possible figures now\u201d. \u201cThere is no culprit\u201d\nLike all countries outside of China, one is currently in the containment phase, said Wieler. That means you want to prevent long-lasting infection chains in the population. So far there have been cases in Germany 16, of which 14 due to the infection by a Chinese employee of the automotive supplier Webasto. Infections that do not originate in China are not yet known.\n\u201cSo far there has been optimism that containment can keep the spread of the virus at bay,\u201d said Wieler. But of course you can't promise that.\n\u201cAt some point it will probably happen that unnoticed infections are suddenly noticed,\u201d said Drosten. The most important thing then is to make it clear that there is no culprit and nothing to scandalize. \u201cThis is a natural phenomenon.\u201d \u201cWe want to save time and decouple\u201d Even in the USA, it would not be possible to prevent \u201cthe virus from entering our country\u201d, said Peter Redfield, director of the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the online portal Stat. But you can save time by extending the containment phase as much as possible.\nRKI boss Wieler is also counting on this: \u201cA major goal that we currently have is to decouple these two waves \u2013 the current wave of influenza and the corona virus that may come.\u201d That is why they are so reliant on containment outside of China. \u201cWe want to save time and decouple,\u201d said Wieler. This is to prevent the health system from being overwhelmed. Lothar Wieler, President of the Robert Koch Institute . Photo: Britta Pedersen / dpa\nAs soon as infection chains occur in Germany that don't As a result of contact with China, experts believe that the containment of the virus has failed. Then you could assume that the virus made it into the population and you would have to change the strategy.\nThen the focus would no longer be on containing the outbreak elsewhere, but on mitigating its consequences. For most people only one cold If the new corona virus really started a second wave of influenza, it would be difficult to maintain normal supply, said Drosten. Planned surgeries may then have to be postponed because intensive care beds that are actually needed for surgical patients are full. In addition, the health offices, which are sparsely staffed, would then be \u201ccompletely overloaded\u201d. \u201cDoctors' offices will be full of patients and normal patients with other diseases will have to wait,\u201d said Drosten.\nThe virologist does not see any reason to panic: \u201cWe have zero risk in Germany at the moment Population\u201d. It is important to inform yourself and to deal with it. For the vast majority of patients, the infection \u2013 if it did come \u2013 will appear as a cold.\nAnd in contrast to influenza, preliminary data shows that children are infected but \u201cpractically not\u201d become more seriously ill. Pregnant women are also not particularly affected \u2013 this is also a major problem with influenza.

Unfortunately, most of the coverage has been about trivial, \"human interest\" matters---like the Canadians trapped in the Wuhan quarantine. Having said that, I have noticed a couple more important stories buried under the emotion-laden fluff. I thought it might be useful to mention them---hopefully more to reinforce than to originally inform. First of all, I noticed a story in the Toronto Star about health care workers concerned about the Doug Ford's decision to get rid of the previous Liberal government's legislation that gave everyone---even minimum wage people---at least two paid sick days a year. The other thing is that our dear Premier's legislation reinstated the idea that employers can force employees to go to a doctor's office to get a sick note. The sop that the Conservatives threw to workers is that everyone is entitled to three unpaid sick days a year. As was pointed out, this is a monumentally stupid state of affairs in a world where there things like infectious diseases and epidemics. It means that people have a very strong economic inducement to go to work when they are feeling sick. Among other things, this means that when you buy a meal from a restaurant, there is a good chance that one of the people handling your food will have a communicable disease which they can share with you. It also means that even if you are lucky to work in an environment with paid sick days you might be forced (as I was several times before I retired) to waste the time of an over-worked health care professional, to leave your home where you are resting (and isolated from the rest of the population), and, wait in a room full of similarly sick people (who might have compromised immune systems) so you can share your illness with them. Secondly, I noticed that experts on emerging infectious diseases were complaining that this new strain of disease had probably emerged when a disease endemic in bats managed to \"jump species\" into human beings. Why would it do so? Well, primarily because some human cultures have a weird tradition of eating \"wild animals\". I'm not talking about First Nations people hunting seals, caribou, etc---I'm talking about rich folks chowing down on, mmm, delicious bat soup. If you can believe this National Geographic article , China has temporarily banned this trade and lots of ordinary people there are pressuring the government to make this permanent. Here's a short Youtube video that shows the same thing in Indonesia. As the National Geographic article above points out, this is not an \"innately Chinese\" thing, but rather something that only a very small number of people do. It is completely and utterly different from what our indigenous people do, as the animals are kept alive, travel long distances, are sometimes factory farmed, and, sold by disgusting markets where many different species are kept \"cheek by jowl\" in appalling conditions. This has created a perfect situation to super-charge the evolution of new strains of infectious diseases for human beings. Just to give you an idea of how bizarre this situation is, there is also some evidence that the virus moved from bats to poisonous snakes (cobras or kraits) before being transmitted to humans. Snakes and bats are two of those species being jammed together in cages at these idiotic disease factories. &&&& One last bit of grotesque information. One of the problems that comes from these infectious diseases stems from the fact that in the modern neo-liberal paradise that we've created a lot of our basic research on things like vaccines is done by private drug companies. And the problem is that there's not a lot of money to be made by creating vaccines for emergent diseases. You do that by sending out \"germ hunters\" to poke around in places like wildlife markets to collect samples and try to figure out what might be the next nasty pathogen. Then these are sent to government laboratories that can classify, identify, sequence the genes, and, so lots of the time-consuming preliminary work that would allow someone to rapidly create a vaccine for it if it emerges as a public health problem. We also need to create infrastructure around the world to keep track of emergent diseases and speed up the response if a pandemic comes along. The problem from a business point of view is that almost none of this work will create any revenue because it is preventative . It might be the case that some corporation might end up with something that would end up being used by huge numbers of people---like the current flu vaccines. But the fact is, that there's no real way of knowing which particular disease that will be ahead of the nasty pandemic. And once we have a second \"black death\" knocking at our doors---given modern air travel---it might very well be too late to accomplish anything before huge numbers of people are already dead. According to an article I found in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics there has been a push to create this sort of infrastructure. In response, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, Wellcome Trust and the governments of Norway and India co-founded the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in 2016, which aims to \u201cstimulate, finance and coordinate the development of vaccines against epidemic diseases, especially in cases in which market incentives alone are insufficient\u201d. Other entities, such as the governments of Germany and Japan, have since joined as investors. But it seems to me that it's kinda ridiculous that this is something that is being funded by a small number of countries and a couple charities instead of being something that every nation on earth (or at least every wealthy, technologically sophisticated nation) supports simply as a way of \"paying your dues\".&&&& Support indie media, subscribe through Patreon or Pay Pal .  Ultimately, this pandemic is just like the climate emergency. It's a symptom of human governments' inability to deal proactively with problems that are emerging from the dramatic expansion of human technology. Why is it that a scientist can't go to a government, explain this sort of problem, and, then get some action on it? Instead, we have to go through this crazy process where activists have to labouriously build consensus, fight back opportunist politicians who try to whip people into a frenzy of opposition, and, ultimately clean up the mess because we waited far, far too long to take rational action. The existing process simply takes too long and inevitably will lead to world-wide catastrophe.  Furthermore I say unto you, the Climate Emergency must be dealt with!

Abstract Full Text Info/History Metrics Preview PDF\nAbstract A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development. Severe infection by 2019-nCov could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 15% of infected individuals 1 , 2 . Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of this virus can associate with the surface receptors of sensitive cells, which mediated the entrance of the virus into target cells for further replication. Recently, Xu et.al., modeled the spike protein to identify the receptor for 2019-nCov, and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this virus 3 . ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-Cov and NL63 4 \u2013 6 . According to their modeling, although the binding strength between 2019-nCov and ACE2 is weaker than that between SARS-Cov and ACE2, it is still much higher than the threshold required for virus infection. Zhou et. al. conducted virus infectivity studies and showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells 7 . These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCov. The expression and distribution of the receptor decide the route of virus infection and the route of infection has a major implication for understanding the pathogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies. Previous studies have investigated the RNA expression of ACE2 in 72 human tissues 8 . However, the lung is a complex organ with multiple types of cells, and such real-time PCR RNA profiling is based on bulk tissue analysis with no way to elucidate the ACE2 expression in each type of cell in the human lung. The ACE2 protein level is also investigated by immunostaining in lung and other organs 8 , 9 . These studies showed that in normal human lung, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type II and type I alveolar epithelial cells. Endothelial cells were also reported to be ACE2 positive. However, immunostaining analysis is known for its lack of signal specificity, and accurate quantification is also another challenge for such analysis. The recently developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology enables us to study the ACE2 expression in each cell type and give quantitative information at single-cell resolution. Previous work has built up the online database for scRNA-Seq analysis of 8 normal human lung transplant donors 10 . In current work, we used the updated bioinformatics tools to analyze the data. In total, we analyzed 43,134 cells derived from normal lung tissue of 8 adult donors. We performed unsupervised graph-based clustering (Seurat version 2.3.4) and for each individual, we identified 8~11 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters based on their marker gene expression profile. Typically the clusters include type II alveolar cells (AT2), type I alveolar cells (AT1), airway epithelial cells (ciliated cells and Club cells), fibroblasts, endothelial cells and various types of immune cells. The cell cluster map of a representative donor (Asian male, 55-year-old) was visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) as shown in Fig. 1b and his major cell type marker expressions were demonstrated in Fig.2 .

Next, we analyzed the cell-type-specific expression pattern of ACE2 in each individual. For all donors, ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells. The majority of the ACE2-expressing cells (averagely 83%) are AT2 cells. Averagely 1.4\u00b10.4% of AT2 cells expressed ACE2. Other ACE2 expressing cells include AT1 cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. However, their ACE2-expressing cell ratio is low and variable among individuals. For the representative donor (Asian male, 55-year-old), the expressions of ACE2 and cell-type-specific markers in each cluster are demonstrated in Fig.2 . To further understand the special population of ACE2-expressing AT2, we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis to study which biological processes are involved with this cell population by comparing them with the AT2 cells not expressing ACE2. Surprisingly, we found that multiple viral process-related GO are significantly over-presented, including \u201cpositive regulation of viral process\u201d (P value=0.001), \u201cviral life cycle\u201d (P value=0.005), \u201cvirion assembly\u201d (P value=0.03) and \u201cpositive regulation of viral genome replication\u201d (P value=0.04). These highly expressed viral process-related genes in ACE2-expressing AT2 include: SLC1A5, CXADR, CAV2, NUP98, CTBP2, GSN,HSPA1B,STOM, RAB1B, HACD3, ITGB6, IST1,NUCKS1,TRIM27, APOE, SMARCB1,UBP1,CHMP1A,NUP160,HSPA8,DAG1,STAU1,ICAM1,CHMP5,D EK, VPS37B, EGFR, CCNK, PPIA, IFITM3, PPIB, TMPRSS2, UBC, LAMP1 and CHMP3. Therefore, it seems that the 2019-nCov has cleverly evolved to hijack this population of AT2 cells for its reproduction and transmission. We further compared the characteristics of the donors and their ACE2 expressing patterns. No association was detected between the ACE2-expressing cell number and the age or smoking status of donors. Of note, the 2 male donors have a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than all other 6 female donors (1.66% vs. 0.41% of all cells, P value=0.07, Mann Whitney Test). In addition, the distribution of ACE2 is also more widespread in male donors than females: at least 5 different types of cells in male lung express this receptor, while only 2~4 types of cells in female lung express the receptor. This result is highly consistent with the epidemic investigation showing that most of the confirmed 2019-nCov infected patients were men (30 vs. 11, by Jan 2, 2020). We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area. Altogether, in the current study, we report the RNA expression profile of ACE2 in the human lung at single-cell resolution. Our analysis suggested that the expression of ACE2 is concentrated in a special population of AT2 which expresses many other genes favoring the viral process. This conclusion is different from the previous report which observed abundant ACE2 not only in AT2, but also in endothelial cells 8 . In fact, to our knowledge, endothelial cells sometimes can be non-specifically stained in immunohistochemical analysis. The abundant expression of ACE2 in a population of AT2 explained the severe alveolar damage after infection. The demonstration of the distinct number and distribution of ACE2-expressing cell population in different cohorts can potentially identify the susceptible population. The shortcoming of the study is the small donor sample number, and that the current technique can only analyze the RNA level but not the protein level of single cells. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether there is any other co-receptor responsible for the 2019-nCov infection, which might also help to explain the observed difference of transmission ability between SARS-Cov and 2019-nCov. Future work on the ACE2 receptor profiling could lead to novel anti-infective strategies such as ACE2 protein blockade or ACE2-expressing cell ablation. Methods Public datasets (GEO: GSE122960) were used for bioinformatics analysis. Firstly, we used Seurat (version 2.3.4) to read a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples. We removed the low-quality cells with less than 200 or more than 6,000 detected genes, or if their mitochondrial gene content was > 10%. Genes were filtered out that were detected in less than 3 cells. For normalization, the combined gene-barcode matrix was scaled by total UMI counts, multiplied by 10,000 and transformed to log space. The highly variable genes were identified using the function FindVariableGenes. Variants arising from number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial genes were regressed out by specifying the vars.to.regress argument in Seurat function ScaleData. The expression level of highly variable genes in the cells was scaled and centered along each gene, and was conducted to principal component analysis. Then we assessed the number of PCs to be included in downstream analysis by (1) plotting the cumulative standard deviations accounted for each PC using the function PCElbowPlot in Seurat to identify the \u2018knee\u2019 point at a PC number after which successive PCs explain diminishing degrees of variance, and (2) by exploring primary sources of heterogeneity in the datasets using the PCHeatmap function in Seurat. Based on these two methods, we selected the first top significant PCs for two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), implemented by the Seurat software with the default parameters. We used FindClusters in Seurat to identify cell clusters for each sample. Following clustering and visualization with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), initial clusters were subjected to inspection and merging based on the similarity of marker genes and a function for measuring phylogenetic identity using BuildClusterTree in Seurat. Identification of cell clusters was performed on the final aligned object guided by marker genes. To identify the marker genes, differential expression analysis was performed by the function FindAllMarkers in Seurat with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differentially expressed genes that were expressed at least in 25% cells within the cluster and with a fold change more than 0.25 (log scale) were considered to be marker genes. tSNE plots and violin plots were generated using Seurat.

It may lead to the false assumption that this was indeed a \"man made\" disease in that laboratory in Wuhan China for biological weapons research, but after carefully looking at the article again, I can say that the researchers who wrote this piece do know their stuff and that they are stating that the fact that Asian people, specifically Asian MEN, have a different make up of Alveolar AT2 cells in their lungs due to natural DNA and RNA make up of their lungs, and that this Wuhan Coronavirus apparently more readily attaches itself to that SPECIFIC makeup.... All this means is that the present Wuhan Coronavirus may indeed be targeting Asian MALES specifically! Nothing artificial therefore to be assumed here at all....\nIt is therefore no wonder that this \"Coronavirus\" is more predominant in China, as it is naturally attracted to lung tissue where it can multiply But hey, this is fact and not fiction here, and try telling this to the criminals in the Jew spew media and even those in the alternative media that are screaming that the \"sky is falling\"....\nHonestly, I do love these scientific reports, for they are RIGHT UP MY ALLEY, and something that brings me back to my University days as a pupil of science I did some dabbling decades ago in Biology as well as my major in Physics, so I find reports like this one to be so refreshing\nI can guarantee one thing, though... There will be those out there that will now scream \"Racism\" after reading this report, as well as claiming that this virus is indeed \"bio-engineered\" due to the fact that it apparently will hit only once certain race of humans... BUT in spite of that ignorance, this is fact and not fiction, and shows once again that we as humans are indeed different in a lot of ways in regards to race, including how we are affected by certain diseases!\nMore to come\nNTS", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["ACE2 and the"], "gensraw_title": [[11599, 18, 291, 263]], "probs_title": [[0.07847622781991959, 0.9674292206764221, 0.06320695579051971, 0.1436111330986023]]}

From Click on Detroit, \u201cMacomb County business raided by the FBI over possible improper COVID-19 treatments\u201d:\n\nFBI agents went into the building wearing full protective gear to protect themselves from potential exposure. Sources claim the raid is because Allure has been allegedly performing treatments for COVID-19 patients without an approved treatment or cure.\n\nOn April 18, Allure\u2019s Facebook page had a post that said \u201cAt Allure Medical, we have been using intravenous vitamin c therapy to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with great results.\u201d\n\nThat post, as well as a post on Allure Medical\u2019s official website on vitamin c treatments, has been taken down.\n\nAfter talking to staff members off-camera, some believe this is a misunderstanding. They claim the vitamin c is meant to help prevent or shorten the duration.\n\nDr. Charles Mok, who owns Allure Medical Spa, did a Facebook live video giving an IV-vitamin c treatment for free to a Detroit police officer. In the video, Mok said \u201cWhat I\u2019m finding in practice \u2014 I treat a lot of COVID patients \u2014 is that if we catch people early, get them on intravenous vitamin c, they turn around really fast.\u201d\n\nWhile it may not be a \u201ccure,\u201d vitamin C is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus in hospitals throughout the world and has been shown to be effective in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure in past studies. Multiple clinical trials to study its effectiveness at treating the coronavirus are currently ongoing.\n\nFOX 2 Detroit, which simply parroted the line fed to them by the FBI, claimed vitamin C is a \u201cfake treatment\u201d and quoted FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider saying the clinic was accused of providing \u201cfraudulent treatments for COVID-19\u201d and allegedly \u201cdid not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.\u201d FOX 2 Detroit said a doctor at the facility told them Dr. Mok is \u201cahead of the curve in this type of treatment and has always put the [patients\u2019] health first, often treating them for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cVitamin C infusion, is a common practice in the US because it boosts the immune system,\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone there for several years and always found them to be so welcoming and helpful and informative,\u201d one of their patients told FOX 2 Detroit.\n\n\u201cThe FBI said that no one is in custody, no arrests were made but they did say that this was an ongoing investigation,\u201d FOX 2 Detroit reported.\n\nHere\u2019s what appears to be a press release Allure Medical put out the day of the raid:\n\nAllure Medical Offering High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C to Frontline Employees\n\nAllure Medical is providing high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy to all frontline employees who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and to existing COVID-19 patients. \u201cWe are using high-dose IV vitamin C to help support peoples\u2019 immune systems and to help those with the virus recover quicker. We want to provide this treatment to those who need it, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d says Dr. Charles Mok, founder of Allure Medical.\n\nIntravenous vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to help the disease associated with COVID-19 \u2013 Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS \u2013 COV 2). In numerous studies intravenous vitamin C appears to reduce the duration and severity in more moderate forms of COVID-19 by stimulating your immune system. High-dose intravenous vitamin C is becoming the standard of care for patients.\n\nIf you are a frontline worker exposed to the COVID-19 or are currently showing any symptoms, you may want to boost your immune system with high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy. Most insurers have waived the co-pay deductibles for COVID-19-related diagnosis. Allure Medical is providing at risk, frontline workers, at no charge. Frontline workers, such as hospital staff, policemen, first responders, grocery store employees and others working closely with the public, are at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, the general public can contact Allure Medical to conduct a telehealth evaluation to determine if immune support with a high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy would be beneficial. Please note: Allure Medical will not treat sick people at the same time as healthy people and continues to exceed CDC guidelines for disinfectants and cleanliness.\n\nThe only statement I can imagine the FBI could have taken issue with is Mok saying they\u2019re using it to \u201chelp those with the virus recover quicker.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been proven yet in double-blind clinical trials that vitamin C helps coronavirus patients recover quicker but this is a doctor recommending a common treatment of a heavily studied, essential vitamin to non-hospitalized patients for (mostly) free.\n\nRaiding his facility and shutting his business down for giving free vitamin C treatments in the midst of a pandemic strikes me as massive overkill.\n\nCould this dispute not have been solved with a simple letter or a phone call?", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["The FBI Is Raid"], "gensraw_title": [[465, 5350, 1149, 12449]], "probs_title": [[0.2922990024089813, 0.9027041792869568, 0.3370709717273712, 0.06067592650651932]]}

These racial profiles, or \u2018genetic markers\u2019, can easily be identified, thus enabling the production of bioweapons targeting certain people. Says Roberts, \u2018For those who doubt that bioweapons can be targeted to specific races or ethnicities, here is a documentary describing how it is done\u2019. We\u2019re posting it below (starting at 41 mins, 20 seconds ):\nDo You Know All Coronavirus Victims Appear To Be Chinese? Thought Not! LANCE WELTON\nAt the time of writing, 170 people have died of the Wuhan Coronavirus [ Coronavirus Live Updates: Death Toll Rises, as Foreigners are Evacuated , New York Times, January 30, 2020], though that number is bound to have increased by the time this article is published.\nAll of these deaths have been in China.\nThe disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020]. The Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians \u2014specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as \u201c Oriental .\u201d\nThus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC.com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be \u201cChinese nationals.\u201d Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read \u201c First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , \u201d [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.\nIn fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a \u201cChinese tourist\u201d [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28, 2020]. So are the cases in France and the one in the United Arab Emirates [ Coronavirus is spreading as FIVE people in France are now confirmed to have the illness and Chinese traveller from Wuhan is quarantined in Finland , by Sam Blanchard, Mail Online, January 29, 2020].\nIf it is true that only East Asians are dying of, or even catching, Corona, that would be consistent with long-established race differences in the susceptibility to such viruses. This has been explored in a fascinating study, by a group of Chinese researchers led by C. L. Chen of Soochow University, entitled: Ethnic differences in susceptibilities to A(H1N1) flu [ African Journal of Biotechnology, 2009].\nThe authors begin by noting that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is every reason to expect there to be ethnic or race differences in the susceptibility to different pathogens . Races\u2014or, as they call them, \u201cethnic groups\u201d\u2014are breeding populations, long-separated, usually by geography, who are, therefore, genetic clusters adapted to different ecologies. Because they were exposed to different pathogens in prehistory, there are very likely to be race differences in susceptibility to the pathogens and in how well the immune system can fight them.\nMany infectious diseases jumped the species barrier from animals to humans due to our close contact with animals while pursuing agriculture. For this reason, groups that never innovated agriculture, or who only innovated it in a limited form or only relatively recently took it up, can be decimated by flu-like viruses.\nThus the authors observe that the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 was three to 70 times more deadly to \u201c natives \u201d in Canada and the USA, as well as to the reindeer herding Saami people in Sweden and Norway, than it was to the rest of these countries\u2019 populations. This is because most white and black people are descended from those who have long practiced farming. The authors add that the Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009 was five times more deadly to Maori people than it was to other New Zealanders.\nThe Corona Virus is closely related to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020], of which there was a major outbreak in 2003 , which also began in China in 2002.\nAccording to Wikipedia (which is, presumably, politically neutral on such numbers), a total of 774 people died across 29 countries. This amounted to almost 10% of those who caught it. Potentially in line with the findings of the Chinese researchers, the mortality rate for SARS in Europe was almost nil. Minuscule numbers of people caught it and only one of them died \u2013 in France (where there were an atypically high 7 cases).\nBy contrast, in Hong Kong the mortality rate from SARS was 17% . In Taiwan, it was 10% . In Canada, it was 17% , but it seems pretty obvious that they were all \u201c Chinese Canadians ,\u201d what with there being so many Chinese people in Canada and documented attempts made to \u201chelp\u201d them (specifically) deal with the virus [see Beyond SARS: ethnic community organization\u2019s role in public health \u2014a Toronto experience, By W. Dong, Promotion and Education, 2008].\nIn Singapore , 13% of those who caught SARS died out of 238 cases. Other countries had very small numbers of cases or, as with Vietnam, their medical access would have been sub-optimal, rendering it difficult to make comparisons.\nBut essentially, it can be said the SARS was an East Asian disease which, like Corona, can be traced to bats. SARS didn\u2019t severely impact the rest of the world, despite people definitely catching it. It disproportionally killed East Asians. See SARS: The Immigration Dimension II , by Walter Pringle , VDARE.com, April 24, 2003.\nThis effect was so pronounced that, Wikipedia reports , \u201cMany Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.\u201d (Ironically, the financial website ZeroHedge has just been banned by Twitter for reporting speculation that the Corona virus was developed during Chinese research into bioweapons\u2014a ban that ZeroHedge attributes in a scathing post to U.S. capitalists\u2019 notorious desire to appease China).\nThe difference between the two strains: the Corona virus, according to experts, is nothing like as deadly as SARS. Its mortality rate appears to be about 2% . It\u2018s mainly taking people with serious pre-existing health conditions [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020].\nSo if I wanted to tempt fate, then I\u2019d write the following:\nThe Corona virus is a virus that, for whatever reason, East Asians are susceptible to but other races are not, just like SARS. None of our people are going to succumb to this condition. The MSM\u2019s constant hyping is just a way of making people panic, because people are more susceptible to being indoctrinated when they panic. By not reporting the race of those who have caught this disease in Europe, unnecessary panic is being fomented among Europeans \u2026so that they can be more easily inculcated with the message than \u201crace differences don\u2019t exist, because race is a social construct.\u201d But race differences do exist. Race is a biological reality. And these kinds of viruses help to prove that.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Deceptive Media blamed"], "gensraw_title": [[5006, 25868, 6344, 13773]], "probs_title": [[0.0001352542167296633, 0.08500487357378006, 0.009788312949240208, 6.123569619376212e-05]]}

Tables were set up with small boxes open on the tables. I heard an air-raid siren wailing close by and the people started running towards the boxes. The boxes held surgical masks. The people were quickly putting them on and running down the hill to the ravine. Pup tents were set up and everyone was piling into them. Sensing the imminent danger I ran to the table grabbed a mask and ran down the hill. I went into the first tent I could find. Several young people were inside the tent panicking. A young girl was crying. We could hear the bombs squealing as they were dropping from the beautiful blue sky. A bomb dropped right beside us and I knew we were doomed. I heard a whirring sound from the bomb and thought it was a dispersant bomb that released some deadly virus or toxin. Some young guy grabbed a defenceless girl and held her up to protect himself from the bomb. What a spineless jerk I thought to myself and I grabbed her and put her behind me trying to protect her from the explosion. I awoke at this point and looked at the clock. It was just after 12am.

When these merge or marry together (like two flints rubbing together), they create an internal fire (phire) that manifests as \u2018the rose gold ray\u2019 or \u2018rose gold flame\u2019 as it is activated. We also used the analogy of three aspects to the trinity. Each aspect being one unit of 33 and one third. We could say that the silver (female) aspect is one 33 and one third unit and the golden (male) aspect is the second 33 and one third unit. The third 33 and one third unit is the \u2018creation\u2019 or the \u2018child\u2019 (the rose gold flame). One symbol that shows this trinity field through geometry is the Celtic knot or \u2018triquetra\u2019. The twin flame presentation of the vesica piscis geometry depicts the masculine, the feminine and the creation as one aspect of the overall trinity, yet is a trinity in itself. Every aspect to each individualised, infinite structure is a holographic replica of the greater and the lesser aspect. Every structure is an \u2019emanation\u2019 of another structure. The triquetra simply shows us the expanded presentation of the vesica piscis.\nA quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire \u2018journey\u2019 of the DNA, if you will.\nThe first exercise we show you, involving the rose gold flame and the utilisation of the Schumann resonance as the antidote to the 5G scrambled field and the black box programme, is to use the symbol of the triquetra. There are several ways this can be done.\nMeditation\nFirstly, you can meditate upon the triquetra simply by visualising the symbol within meditation. You can also move into an \u2018open-eyed\u2019 meditation where you are in a relaxed, meditative space whilst looking at the triquetra symbol. You can also look at the symbol as the very last image you look at before you go to sleep at night. This is especially helpful if you wish to use dream magick and dream healing as part of your antidote creation. If you do decide to use the triquetra symbol as a trigger into dreamtime investigation/magick and healing, then you must \u2018prepare your sleeping space\u2019 before you do this. If you are sleeping outdoors in nature, there is no need to prepare your space as nature has already done this for you. Indoors, you would need to make sure all Wi-Fi and Internet signals are turned off in your home and all electronic equipment is removed from your bedroom. Make sure there is no metal within the mattress or bed frame you sleep upon, and do your best to utilise chemical-free bedding. Having crystals in your bedroom is especially helpful. Orgonite also.\nWithin your meditation or visualisation (closed or open-eyed looking at the triquetra image), imagine that the triquetra is a brilliant and bright silver colour. Make sure you hold that beautiful silver colour in your mind\u2019s eye. You should feel an opening of the heart when doing this. Then imagine that the triquetra symbol is becoming a golden colour, getting brighter and brighter until all the silver colour has now been replaced with the gold. Then visualise the gold changing colour, taking on a pink hue and eventually becoming rose gold in colour. This is a very simple but very powerful exercise. This will trigger \u2018downloads\u2019 within dreamtime or meditation if you are a natural medium or channel. This exercise in itself can bring about balance and natural healing.\nTo strengthen and boost this exercise, you can keep rose quartz crystal by your bedside. A crystal wand or a crystal skull holds even more powerful, activating energy.\nA quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire \u2018journey\u2019 of the DNA, if you will.\nShields that connect into Schumann resonance fields can also be created through water. Swimming in natural ocean water is an extremely powerful shield as the Schumann resonance is amplified through the oceans upon your planet. This can be recreated within your own bathtubs at home using Himalayan salts or any magnesium-based salts. Certain aromatherapy creations and herbs can also create shielding, as can placing crystals within the bathtub. The only case where it is not advisable to create a water shield in your bathtub, is when your bath is made of metal. This would scramble the signal and have the opposite effect (as in, lack of shield and focus away from Schumann resonance). The most powerful material for creating a water shield is stone such as crystal, followed by wood. A crystal bathtub full of sea salt is an absolute replica of the ocean and creates a \u2018super conductor\u2019 directly into the Schumann resonance fields. We also recommend you utilise a heavy metal detoxification programme. The reason for this is that metals within the organic human body system can \u2018lock. on\u2019 to the Wi-Fi 5G scrambled system and amplify it, so cleansing from heavy metals within the body is a shield in itself. The dark green leafy vegetables from the land and the seaweeds from unpolluted waters are able to chelate these heavy metals from the body. We recommend the blue-green algae also, such as chlorella and spirulina.\nWhen you visualise the rose gold flame, you create an image in your mind\u2019s eye that \u2018activates\u2019 through the pineal gland visual cortex system. The rose gold (and indeed the symbol of the rose itself) is a known symbol within what we may call the \u2018cosmic alphabet\u2019 or the \u2018language of light\u2019. When you visualise the rose gold flame, you speak directly to the DNA. When you create the rose gold flame as a shield, then the molecular structure within your body as silicate/crystalline follows suit (through a process similar to that which is known as \u2018cymatics\u2019and your entire energy field naturally keys into the Schumann resonance.\nIf enough individuals hold this belief system and follow similar spiritual exercises, then collectively the Schumann resonance will be spiked and kept at a high enough frequency to \u2018drown out\u2019 the 5G network and chemical bombardment. Either in meditation or in a relaxed state, we would ask you to visualise a silver candle and a gold candle. Both these candles burn one flame each. The silver candle burns a golden flame. The gold candle burns a silver flame. Sit with this visualisation for a few minutes, simply watching the candles and the burning flames. This exercise balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain, as well as communicating directly with the DNA about the shielding technique you are employing. The intrinsic intelligence within the cellular structure of the entire bodymind knows what you are doing. After a while, we would ask you to draw the candles closer and closer together until the silver candle burning a golden flame and the gold candle burning a silver flame become one candle and one flame. As the candles merge together, gold and silver, the colour of the candle begins to turn a beautiful rose colour with a matching rose coloured flame.\nYet The sparkle of the gold remains, creating a rose gold colour. You are now watching a rose gold candle burning a rose gold flame, and you are fully aware that the rose gold is a merge of the silver and the gold. Know that the right hemisphere of the brain (silver) and the left hemisphere of the brain (gold) have created a unified brain pattern, where the left and right hemispheres are in equal balance. Within the pineal gland, a beautiful diamond liquid crystal of a metallic rose gold colour has been created. This rose gold crystal liquid then seeps down from the brain stem into the throat, and you visualise yourself drinking this rose gold liquid. Know that this is \u2018ambrosia\u2019 or indeed \u2018nectar of the Gods\u2019. As you drink this delicious and sweet nectar, you visualise the flame of the rose gold candle getting bigger and bigger. The rose gold flame begins to surround you, like a ring of fire around you. The candle has unified with the flame and now, sitting in sacred space, there is just you surrounded by the rose gold flame ring of fire. Allow this ring of fire to completely surround you until it eventually becomes a ball of fire, like a rose-gold-pink orb, with you sitting in the centre, nurtured and protected.\nWith thanks to Magenta Pixie\u2019TheBlack Box programme and the Rose Gold Flame\u2019\nU", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Gravity is Strong"], "gensraw_title": [[39, 16996, 319, 13536]], "probs_title": [[0.0009764054557308555, 0.014397080056369305, 0.034166119992733, 0.011831311509013176]]}

The word \u2018nationalist\u2019 brings to mind the Nazis, where we are regularly reminded that they were \u201cNational Socialists\u201d, emphasizing the first word in the phrase, but never the second. Like I said, self-serving myths.\nHowever, while the word \u2018socialist\u2019 hasn\u2019t changed all that much since the 1930\u2019s, the word \u2018nationalist\u2019 has. In other words, its a logical fallacy called \u2018equivocation,\u2019 where the same word has two different meanings. Globalists (and the MSM, the general public, liberal progressives, etc) invoke the old meaning to criticize adherents of the new meaning.\nThere was indeed something nasty about the \u201cold\u201d nationalists, but people don\u2019t really like to acknowledge what it is. Was much of it \u2018racist\u2019? Yes, of course. But it was \u2018racist\u2019 for a reason: they believed that SCIENCE had shown, in light of Darwinism, that the races were definitely different, and indeed some races were superior to others. And yet, it is still not fair to equate the \u201cold\u201d nationalism with racism, as, in point of fact, racism was infused into anti -nationalist, communist, and even progressive views, as well . Yet, people recoil in horror at the word \u2018nationalist\u2019 but carry on their merry way when they hear the word \u2018progressive.\u2019\nThe reason why people don\u2019t like to admit the historical reality of the pervasiveness (beyond, except, when ascribed to \u2018nationalists\u2019) of \u2018scientific racism\u2019 is because they still like to claim the mantle of SCIENCE, which at present still accepts Darwinism as true and valid. They want their Darwinism without the part where they behave as if it is actually true, which is pretty much all that separates them from the progressives of the 1920\u2019s to 1930\u2019s, where they were courageous enough to behave as though Darwinism was true.\nI have a whole page on my eugenics website dedicated to progressives complaining that people would not submit to SCIENCE and instead resort to sentimentality.\nThe short story here on how Darwinism became attached to these \u2018political\u2019 aspects is that the prevailing notion of the time that a \u2018nation\u2019 was basically a repository for a particular subset of the human species, and that such subsets could themselves be seen as operating on Darwinian principles. Eg, the \u2018social organism.\u2019 Thus, there was \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 not just between rival, individual organisms, but also between populations. We still have the concept today, actually. It is called \u201cintraspecific competition.\u201d (And thus, why it is the case that so long as Darwinism is believed to be true, there will be people who believe it ought to be extended to \u2018race\u2019, etc).\nGermany believed it was the fittest and that it had the evolutionary right and obligation, as a people, to devour those who were not as fit\u2013and this would be good for the entire human race. This explains that little known fact that before the Nazis began wide scale extermination of the Jews, they first launched the T4 project, in which hundreds of thousands of GERMAN citizens who were disabled, mentally ill, etc, were exterminated. Such people dragged down the \u2018social organism\u2019 (eg, \u201cuseless eaters\u201d) and stood in the way of a \u2018fit\u2019\u201cbody.\u201d This was laid out in Binding and Hoche\u2019s \u201c Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life \u201d which was published years before the Nazi party even existed. The \u2018nation\u2019 was in essence an \u2018organism\u2019 subject to Darwinian principles.\nGermany was country to have a large concentration of people who believed such things. Turkey (when killing the Armenians) had a similar conception, as did Japan (the Rape of Nanking, killing of prisoners, etc). WW1 was, as you can imagine, a humiliation for Germany and Turkey, who believed they were biologically superior. Likewise Japan after WW2. But there were people who had this notion diffused throughout the world, including the United States: This is not theory, but fact, and displays its force as fact, whatever theories may be thrown across its track.Living political constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in practice . Society is a living organism and must obey the laws of life ,\nWoodrow Wilson. American president.\nYipes!\nIt will be hard to find many more \u2018internationalist\u2019 than Wilson without going full Bolshevik. So, like I said, this \u2018nasty\u2019 business is not at all uniquely identifiable with early 20th century \u2018nationalism.\u2019\nSo, look. Even if it logically follows from Darwinism that nations should be seen as \u201cliving organisms\u201d that must \u201cobey the laws of life\u201d, there are very few people who believe that, today. And certainly not most \u2018nationalists.\u2019\nAND CERTAINLY NOT ME. (I, for one, think Darwinism is excrement.)\nI lead with this, because the Globalists like to think that it is thanks to them and their institutions that the world has enjoyed relative peace after WW2. Ah, no.\nFirst of all, this Darwinian-infused notion of \u2018nationalism\u2019 that existed prior to WW2 disappeared for the same reason that eugenics itself fell by the wayside. Eugenicists were humiliated by the outcome of WW2, shocked that their ideas could lead to such horrors. They repackaged and pursued their views via \u2018 crypto-eugenics \u2018 afterwards. But there was not much room for a \u2018social body\u2019 explanation anymore, as the countries which postured as Supremely Superior biologically speaking were destroyed\u2026 by American mutts.\nThe Globalists like to invoke international organizations, especially the UN, but they are reluctant to mention NATO in the same analysis. NATO is an international organization, but it is an organization centered on exerting MILITARY POWER. And within NATO, the number one puncher is, hands down, without a doubt, the United States of America. To cut to the chase, the relative peace the world has enjoyed has been thanks to the USA and its doctrine of being ready to fight\u2013and win\u2013a global war fought on two fronts.\nWithout the US, most of the world would be speaking German, Japanese, and/or Russian right now. That\u2019s a fact.\nGlobalists want to trumpet the success of their institutions while ignoring the protective shield that the United States has provided for them over the decades. They are like the secretary who works in the office of a NFL football team that wins the Super Bowl. Sure, the secretary gets the ring, just like the players, and indeed, the secretary has contributed to the overall success of the team, but no one would fail to understand that the ones who chiefly provided the victory were the ones on the field, slamming away at another team for four quarters.\nIn the same way, the UN has perhaps done some occasional good, but whatever good they accomplished they accomplished because the US (primarily) was standing behind them with a billy club.\nBut I would dispute even the idea that we can even say there has been \u2018relative peace\u2019 after WW2. There hasn\u2019t been another World War but that does not seem like the only criterion that should be on the table. Let\u2019s be real: since WW2, hundreds of million were killed in various communist countries, there were civil wars, there were genocides in Rwanda (also infused with Darwinism) and Cambodia, etc., etc. Relative peace? I think not.\nEvents like Rwanda lay bare the failure of globalism\u2026 the eventual salvation of whatever Tutsis that were left was thanks to other , armed Tutsis, that came over the border. Maybe Kuwait can thank the international community for rescuing it from Saddam, but the Kurds, who were immediately abandoned after Kuwait was liberated might have another view. (Inexplicably, the globalists thought leaving Saddam alive and in power was a good idea, and Saddam used the opportunity to secure his position, by killing loads of Kurds.)\nRelative peace in the United States and the West, perhaps, but that\u2019s as far as it goes.\nHaving a realistic true history of the 20th century is critical, I think, because there is very little in it to support the notion that any of us can trust our safety and security to bureaucrats who reside thousands of miles away, unless, perhaps, they are bureaucrats working in the Pentagon.\nSo, in my conception of \u2018nationalism\u2019, I am going back to something which pre-dates even Darwinism. When the United States was founded, the individual states were essentially and effectively viewed as sovereign nations in their own right. On this republican (small \u2018r\u2019) view, the powers of the federation were narrowly construed, and the nations\u2013that is, American states\u2013served as an important check and balance on tyranny at the federation level.\nI am a \u2018nationalist,\u2019 in this sense, because I believe that in light of the realities of human history, extremely robust checks and balances are needed in every place where power is centered. Ultimately, the citizens of the many nations should be construed as the final check and balance, and should be armed in such a way that the tyrants really are afraid to over-reach. But what to do when other nations over-step and over-reach right into your own nation?\nWell, in the past, one generally assumed that the people leading your own nation would put their foot down and attempt to protect the interests of the people who elected those leaders. But this is not the case when globalists run the show, especially when they are the ones at the steering wheel. Many examples could be given, but for the purpose of this post, I\u2019m going to use the corona virus to explain, with some reference to the ebola outreak about six years ago.\nThe reaction to the corona virus has, in my mind, generally shown the powerful way that nations can be a check and balance against other nations. It did not take very long for individual countries to start locking down their borders, quarantining people coming from suspected regions in China, etc., etc. Excellent. As it should be.\nGiven such events, we do begin to see some of the narrow instances where are our international organizations have value. These epidemics have an international component almost by definition. But it is one thing to let these people do their work and it is quite another to give them governance .\nWhy? Because they don\u2019t care about you , that\u2019s why. Well, not exclusively, anyway. To the globalist, your interests needs to be weighed against the interests of other people\u2019s interests, and, naturally, they are in their mind perfectly suited to be the arbiter in such things.\nThus, for example, let\u2019s pretend that it was determined that it appeared there was going to be an outbreak leading to thousands of deaths in either region X or region Y. It could not be stopped. It was going to happen in one of these places. The only question was whether or not we could direct it to a particular region, and then actually do it. The globalist feels perfectly comfortable weighing the relative merits of each option. Perhaps they will not be quite happy that people in region X will suffer if region Y is spared, but again, on their view, it falls to them to be concerned about the people in both regions.\nNow, if you happen to live in region X, you might feel altogether differently about it. It is your kids, your wife or husband, your livelihood, perhaps even your life on the line. It is you being asked to \u2018take the hit.\u2019 And the globalist? Well, he doesn\u2019t answer to you, does he? You have no way to hold him accountable. You didn\u2019t elect him. You will probably never learn his name. What if the entire premise is wrong\u2013that is to say, perhaps in point of fact, there is no reason to believe that it WAS going to happen in one of those two places in the first place. That is, the globalist was wrong .\nCan you imagine that? A globalist being wrong? (The globalist can\u2019t believe it.) And to whom or to what can you appeal in that case?\nIf, in fact, there are significant checks and balances on the globalist and/or his institutions, the globalist can end up doing a lot of damage. The nationalist certainly can do a lot of damage, too. What is the only way to check either? Other nations.\nIn the Ebola incident, more than 11,000 people died . This is more than a third of all those believed to have been impacted. At present, almost the same number of people believed to have been infected (officially) is the same as in the Ebola incident (around 28,000) but there have only been a little over 500 deaths. [ This seems reliable enough .] It strikes me as strange that in the Ebola outbreak, amid calls to shut down travel from that region, etc, there were globalists who decried such measures as \u2018mean\u2019, despite the disease killing 1 out of every 3 individuals, whereas with the Corona Virus, no one really had to issue any calls to take action because everyone\u2013nations, international organizations, etc,\u2013took appropriate action immediately\u2026 including shutting down travel from out of that region! This, when the Corona Virus, by comparison, is only killing (so far) 1 out of every 50 individuals. And no one accusing anyone for being mean!\nIs it because the Chinese are not as lovable in the globalists\u2019 eyes as the West Africans? I really don\u2019t know the answer, but it does strike me as odd.\nThe thing that really bothered me during the Ebola incident was the clear fact that the Globalist-in-Chief, Obama, seemed perfectly prepared to subsume the interests and welfare of the United States. The US was basically the \u2018region X\u2019 from the scenario above. The nightmare was that the one actually elected to represent us didn\u2019t seemed to care all that much about us. And hence, a lesson about electing globalists to represent you.\nThere are many examples that I could give to expound on this, but the corona virus thing seems to illustrate one of the benefits of having nations led by people concerned for the people who have placed them into power. There is no hint that this time around there are going to be calls for a global kumbaya because individual countries are proactively defending their own citizens.\nMight this mean that somewhere down the line we may have to \u2018rescue\u2019 China? Perhaps. I\u2019m sure many a \u2018nationalist\u2019 like myself will be happy to consider the prospects and act if necessary. What we don\u2019t like is being called upon to sacrifice our own lives, the lives of our loved ones, or our general welfare, by the very people who were supposed to represent us.\nIndeed, in a case like this, it seems the oxygen mask analogy would be appropriate. When you are on an airplane, they counsel you to put the oxygen mask on yourself, first, before tending to those less able to fend for themselves. The reason for this is very simple: if they are less able to fend for themselves, they are less able to help YOU, if you falter. Thus, helping yourself first isn\u2019t merely being \u2018selfish\u2019 of \u2018uncompassionate.\u2019 By saving one (yourself), you increase the odds of saving both.\nIf healthier nations are asked to accept risks in order to dilute the risks to the other, less healthy nation, this could jeopardize our ability to help both.\nOther examples abound, as I said. I am using the corona virus to illustrate.\nBut an aside before I move on.\nI recently had a face to face conversation with a politician and the topic was oriented towards protecting the interests of my family. This politician, very earnest and genuine, hastened to remind me that he had to look after the interests of all the families in the area. This is the globalist spirit, writ smaller. You see, there are two ways of approaching such issues. In one approach, you recognize that you can\u2019t be everyone\u2019s daddy, even if you wanted to, and so, being concerned (genuinely) for all the families in the area, you strive to equip ALL the parents so that they can do what they are best situated to do\u2013tend to their own families. In the other approach, you say, \u201cWell, there are families that will not have parents who can do their job, so, hell, I guess I\u2019ll just be everyone\u2019s parent.\u201d\nThere is no argument with the former viewpoint. It is the second viewpoint where problems emerge. Practically speaking, nobody can be everyone\u2019s daddy. The globalist pretends that he is intellectually, spiritually, and morally capable of balancing the unique needs and interests of every single person on the globe, and from his Godlike perch, able also to act appropriately. But, although he may not ever see the damage he does (he probably won\u2019t bother to look to see if he hurt someone along the way; for the globalist, only his good intentions matter, not the actual outcomes), there will be thousands of unanticipated consequences because, well, in point of fact, the globalist is NOT God.\nOne of the unanticipated (to them) consequences is that by acting to be everyone\u2019s daddy, they necessarily enact and pursue policies which make it harder for actual fathers to appropriately protect their own family.\nConsider a hypothetical to illustrate. Let\u2019s say that I lived in a flood zone. Being the proactive father that I am, let\u2019s say that I acquire a boat in order to get my family out of the area if it came to it. But my local globalist thinks its unfair that some people don\u2019t have boats in case of flooding. To solve the problem, he outlaws private ownership of boats, and creates an agency which is in charge of all the boats, which they will then dispatch as necessary. On paper, perhaps, this will help the overall community in case of a flood, but it has come at the expense of taking my boat. Now I don\u2019t have a boat if there is a flood. I cannot get them away and return in my boat to help others, because I have no boat.\nAnd if my family drowns because the new agency fouled up in their response\u2013or even if they acted effectively, but were constrained by circumstances\u2013should I be happy that I was asked to sacrifice my family so that other people, who had perfectly good opportunities to be proactive themselves, but didn\u2019t, could, theoretically, live?\nYour globalists thinks you should be very happy. And why not? It isn\u2019t his family.\nMany, many, many, many policies and viewpoints are advanced exactly along those lines. In the name of the community, they deprive, disarm, defund, etc, individuals. At least as long as there are such things as \u2018nations\u2019/\u2019states\u2019, counties, municipalities, and townships, etc, where there is a halfway decent chance of reflecting the actual interests of the actual people who elect them, there is a good chance that some seriously bad (totalitarian level) things never take place.\nThus, I am a \u2018nationalist,\u2019 in just the same sense that I consider my home state to be a nation. Or, at least it used to be. With the steady encroachment of wanna-be-daddies over the last hundred years, even what we have is at risk. Someday, the globalists will foul it up so much that even they can\u2019t deny what happened. (Remember, as a general rule, they rarely investigate the outcomes of their policies). Can you imagine how many people will have suffered and died in order to catch their attention at last?\nIt makes me shudder to think of it.

We hear also of firemen being held back from attending fires (run by UN now apparently) and no will to employ geoengineering tech and put out the Aussie fires. Then we have the Police deciding not to send help to the Whakaari/White Is eruption victims but taking credit later even when it was Joe Public who went to their help, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned all of the 1080 anomalies in our Court system even. It\u2019s all coming to light quite plainly of late the lying. Add to that the heavy censorship going on of all things truth. Recently Facebook that is doubling down on all independent info & truth, they removed a post of mine by a Harvard immunologist. They are not even smart enough to remove something that maybe looks fake \u2026 but a Harvard immunologist? That alone tells what people will swallow without question. Problem with the post was she was talking about vaccines and the unvaccinated posing no risk, and of course the truth on that topic is bursting out so wildly they\u2019ve got the WHO vaccine safety folks scrambling for some good answers to give those pesky inquiring parents who weirdly enough want to protect their children from injury. One in 39 according to CDC\u2019s own stats are injured. Who would want to take that very high risk yet they are pushing for mandatory?

Your corporations parading as governments are not doing that \u2026 they are not testing 5G for instance (nor heeding the independent science) and unleashing it on you anyway so YOU are the test case. They do this with vaccines & pharmaceuticals as well. No LT studies or proof of safety required (as happened with glyphosate in Roundup) plus in the case of vaccines have been protected as industries from any kickback should you want to sue them. Protect yourself therefore, going by the info that you have, particularly the independent info, from reliable sources of course. Cover all bases. You\u2019ve nothing to lose in doing that. Have a read below the video of Jim Humble\u2019s recent spiel. (Thanks to NZ Rose for that info). His is very helpful advice. EWR \u201cHello, Some of you have written asking for my thoughts on the latest coronavirus which is making headlines these days. To start, here is one definition of coronavirus: Coronaviruses are types of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans. They are associated with the common cold, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and can also affect the gut. News agencies report that the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China is rapidly evolving and reportedly (at the time of this writing),infections from the virus have now been found on other continents and several other countries in Asia have reported cases as well. Signs of the virus are fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\u2014however, it has been reported that some carriers of this strain of coronavirus show no respiratory symptoms at all. This makes it extremely difficult to detect carriers of the virus, taking into account that health officials are looking for respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and breathing difficulties. Another report said some carriers have no fever and no coughing, but instead are exhibiting symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and chest pains. At the time of writing this, statistics vary according to the news as to how many confirmed cases there are worldwide, as well as deaths. It has been reported that China is moving to restrict travel and schools in Hong Kong and the mainland are postponing classes. Some say the situation is far worse than what is being reported, others suggest it is a hoax. The purpose of this newsletter is not to analyze or speculate what is behind all of this, or try to project where it is all going. As most would agree, we live in very unique times\u2014whether you believe this and other similar outbreaks are part of a great conspiracy, or signs of the times according to Biblical predictions, or whatever other reason\u2014I would like to say, it\u2019s a good time to have some MMS on hand and educate yourself in its use. MMS (sodium chlorite activated with a food grade acid which then produces chlorine dioxide) kills most of the diseases of mankind. I don\u2019t know for sure about the coronavirus at this time\u2014but we know that MMS kills viruses as well as pathogens of all kinds and is an immune system builder. There is much anecdotal evidence that says MMS has proven very effective in eradicating viruses including Ebola, Swine Flu, TB, and other respiratory diseases. Chlorine dioxide was completely effective against Anthrax in 2001, and used by US Military for Ebola in 2014. It\u2019s been proven by the Red Cross in 2012 to eradicate malaria in just four hours, to name a few. I have been receiving feedback for over 22 years from people all around the world who have given testimony of how they recovered their health from a vast variety of disease, many life-threatening, with MMS. Therefore, I have every reason to believe it can be effective in stopping and preventing the current novel coronavirus going around today. For more information and some important facts on MMS, as well as the history of MMS, go here: Important Facts Regarding MMS ( http://mail.mmsnews.org/index.php?option=com_acymailing&ctrl=ur \u2026 ) Again, I have reason to believe, MMS (chlorine dioxide), can be very effective in both preventing and eradicating the coronavirus. With the barrage of health issues in the world today, I would say, let MMS be your first line of defense. Why not be prepared for whatever may come your way? It\u2019s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. The point is, we never know when an emergency or \u201coutbreak\u201d of some illness is going to happen. Weather it is a stroke, or a heart attack, an accident or this year\u2019s epidemic. We need to be prepared ahead of time and not wait until it\u2019s too late. A great way to prepare is to educate yourself on MMS. The best way you can do this, in my opinion, is get the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook, available here: jhbooks.org ( http://mail.mmsnews.org/index.php?option=com_acymailing&ctrl=ur \u2026 ) This book is a clear and concise guide to all you need to know in order to recover health with MMS, as well as how to strengthen your immune system by staying overall toxin free. So get the Guidebook, study it, familiarize yourself with it and have MMS on hand. Regarding the coronavirus, at this point in time if you have it, I would suggest trying MMS first as MMS has eradicated a wide range of maladies. In my own personal experience traveling around the world and helping people with many different diseases, I have to say there have been positive results at least 95% of the time. I would say those are pretty good odds. At this time MMS is being used by thousands and thousands of people in more than 185 countries. Below are provisional steps one can take, a variation of my standard protocols and Health Recovery Plan, but something to try immediately in the case of coronavirus until you can get the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook. Here\u2019s my suggestion: MMS must be activated drop for drop with the activator. Mix the drops in a clean dry glass, count 30 seconds so the drops can activate\u2014they should turn amber color. After the 30 second count add 1/2 cup (4 ounces/120ml) of water, then immediately drink it down. (Do not leave this to sit for more than a few seconds, it must be taken immediately or it will begin to lose potency.) First, take six activated drops of MMS in 1/2 cup of water. Wait one hour, and then take six more activated drops in 1/2 cup of water. That may do it. You will know within two hours if it killed the disease by how you feel. What to do next depends upon how those first two doses made you feel. Follow these next directions carefully: If you feel better after taking the two 6-drop doses of MMS, reduce your intake to 3 activated drops in 1/2 cup of water every hour for eight hours a day, until completely well. You may want to continue this for up to 21 days to be sure you are free of disease and as an overall detoxification of the body. Always take the MMS within seconds of mixing up the dose. Any time you should feel worse when taking MMS, proceed with Any time after taking MMS activated drops you feel worse, cut your intake by one half but do not stop hourly doses. If you still feel worse cut your intake by one half again, but continue with hourly doses. Feeling worse after taking the MMS drops such as showing signs of nausea, diarrhea or headache is actually a sign that you are ridding your body of toxins. It is called a Herxheimer reaction. It indicates you are killing the disease, but you are killing it too fast\u2014the point is go slow enough so as not to make yourself unnecessarily uncomfortable. These suggestions are only to get you started should you come down with a life threatening virus. You need the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook for complete instructions. There are more details and important things to know for getting well, such as do not take things that neutralize MMS such as coffee, tea, orange juice, milk, alcohol, things very high in antioxidants and so on, at the same time you take MMS doses. I wrote the Guidebook with all the details in mind, I simply cannot repeat it all here\u2014so get the book. In the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook, I have outlined a Health Recovery Plan which gives full instructions and protocols on how to handle other illness and disease. If you do not have coronavirus, but you think you have been exposed, you might want to take two 6-drop doses of MMS, an hour apart. I would then suggest doing the Starting Procedure, followed by Protocol 1000, as a preventative measure and as an overall detoxification of your body. And last, but not least, I recommend a daily maintenance dose of MMS for all. Full details of these protocols are found in the MMS Health Recovery Guidebook, available here: jhbooks.org ( http://mail.mmsnews.org/index.php?option=com_acymailing&ctrl=ur \u2026 ) As mentioned above, educate yourself now\u2014familiarize yourself with MMS today, don\u2019t wait until you are in the middle of a crisis. All the best and good fortune to you along the way, Jim Humble This is my disclaimer as it seems everyone must have a disclaimer now days: I have shared certain views and opinions in the above Newsletter.

The data from China, the best we can tell, suggests that 15% of those who contract the virus die, and 83% of those exposed to the virus, develop symptoms. This 15% death rate approximately follows the death rate of the lethal Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million victims, including some 675,000 Americans. This has the potential, although it has reached epidemic proportions in Wuhan, China, to become a global epidemic. As one of the main speakers at the Real Truth About Health Conference in Melville, NY last weekend, I noted that many of the attendees expressed fear about the virus. Fear, of itself, weakens the immune system, making one more vulnerable to viral infection. The good news is that, based on my clinical experience in treating viral infections, singlet atoms of iodine ( I- ) have been shown to be the most powerful antiviral substance available to us. I- is also a very powerful antioxidant. These antioxidant qualities are important because these viral infections release free radicals that tend to break down the system. The I- is also a mucolytic \u2013 It dissolves mucus in the system, such as in lung infections, which happen to be common in the case of the coronavirus. I- is also anti-inflammatory. In my scientific opinion, I- is the best and healthiest anti-viral available to us. Historically, the world research shows that no virus can withstand iodine , and, in particular, I- creates an instant kill of the virus.\nI also recommend taking an immune boosting herbal combination called Mega Defense , which I generally suggest at 4 capsules twice daily, as a preventative measure at this time. Given the fact that viral infections generate free radicals, I recommend you increase overall antioxidant consumption with such products as Antioxidant Extreme . These are the basics of creating a defensive shield against the coronavirus. Iodine \u2019s powerful qualities strongly suggest, although we don\u2019t have direct experience, that iodine gives a high level of preventative protection from being infected by the coronavirus. This is not a claim based on clinical evidence with the coronavirus, but, is based on my general experience with I- in treating viral infections. I make no claim to have direct experience with the coronavirus, but generally speaking, this is the best we can do, as no one has any real experience with this virus.\nIn my clinical experience, the optimum viral protection in general is 20 drops of I- daily dissolved in water (taken on an empty stomach). It\u2019s best to wait 15 minutes before eating anything. If you happen to have a coronaviral infection already, based on my general experience (with no direct experience with this coronavirus), I\u2019ve found that 5-15 drops per hour until the infection is gone is a reasonable protocol for most viral infections.\nOne warning about this protocol: If someone is on thyroid medication and begins to experience heart palpitations on this protocol, stop taking the iodine immediately. Wait several days and slowly start one drop at a time.\nAs I do not have any experience in treating the coronavirus, and hope I never have to, I obviously cannot make any specific claims for the treatment of the coronavirus with iodine. This recommendation, however, is based on a generally safe and effective approach in preventing and healing most viral infections. Additionally, people can have an occasional excessive detoxification reaction from iodine, as it forces fluoride, lead, mercury, and cadmium out of the system.\nPeople may feel symptoms such as nausea, burning throat, and heart palpitations. If this happens, discontinue iodine use immediately. Wait several days and begin again with one drop three times daily. Although I\u2019ve never actually seen this happen with anyone, if people become nauseated during detox, it may be helpful to put an eighth of a teaspoon on the tip of the tongue of Transformational Salt and touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, followed by 16 ounces of water.\nThe form of iodine I have found to be most effective is a singlet oxygen atom of iodine ( I- ) called Illumodine . Although I believe other singlet atomic iodine can work, this is the only form I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s organic, radiation-free, and 100% pure (as it\u2019s mined deep beneath the ground in South America). The other important aspect is that in the singlet atomic I- form, it is estimated to be 100% bioavailable. It is true scalar wave energized, which, in my clinical experience, makes it algae free.\nAs I, like most physicians, have no direct experience in treating the coronavirus, I can\u2019t make any definitive claim to prevention or treatment, but this seems like a reasonable and relatively safe approach given the seriousness of the potential coronavirus epidemic.\nThese statements that I\u2019m making haven\u2019t been evaluated by the FDA, and we don\u2019t claim this product diagnostic, curative, a treatment, or a preventative of any disease.\nMy concern as a doctor, a grandparent, and a parent is to protect my immediate and larger family from this potential, lethal epidemic.\nIn concern for your health and wellbeing, Dr. Gabriel Cousens, MD, MD(H), ND(hc), DD ", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Thinking Bob,"], "gensraw_title": [[818, 8041, 5812, 12]], "probs_title": [[0.0003387141041457653, 0.20657934248447418, 2.4891314751585014e-05, 0.1925455629825592]]}

The structure of the 2019-NCoV virus genome provides a very strong clue on the likely origin of the virus.\nUnlike other related coronaviruses, the 2019-nCoV virus has a unique sequence about 1,378 bp (nucleotide base pairs) long that is not found in related coronaviruses.\nLooking at the phylogenetic tree recently published derived using all the full genome sequence, we see the 2019-nCoV virus does not have clear monophyletic support given the bootstrap value of 75 (Fig 1). Close-up on Bootstrap value of 75 for available 2019-nCoV from Lu et al., 2020 The Lancet article [ Full Text ]\nThere is no doubt that there is a novel sequence in 2019-nCoV; we confirmed this via sequence alignment.

They conducted a codon-bias analysis which led them to speculate that perhaps there had been a recombination event between a coronavirus in snakes with a coronavirus from bats (Ji et al., 2020). [ Full Text ]\nThis led to criticism on Wired(3) with quote dismissing the snake origin hypothesis as lacking evidence. There is, however, clear evidence that the novel sequence, which I will refer to henceforth as INS1378, is from a laboratory-induced recombination event. Specifically,\n(1) The sequence similarity to other coronavirus sequences is lower to its most similar sequences in any coronavirus than the rest of the genome (IPAK finding)\n(2) The high sequence similarity of INS1378 to a SARS spike protein (2; IPAK Confirmed) .\n(3) We also found significant sequence similarity of INS1378 to a pShuttle-SN vector that was in use in the 1980\u2019s in China to create a more immunogenic coronavirus (IPAK finding, details below, Option 4).\nHere, I review four Option on the origins of the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus isolated from human patients from Wuhan, China.\nOption 1. Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a Recombined Virus .\nEvidence for: Phylogenetic clustering with Bat coronaviruses.\nEvidence against: Low bootstrap support (N=75) and presence of a INS1378.\nStatus: Falsified hypothesis.\nTest: Survey coronviruses in animals in the wild.\nOption 2. A recombined virus that naturally picked up a SARS-like spike protein in it N-terminus (3\u2032 end) of the viral genome.\nEvidence for: The INS1378 codon bias similar to snakes ($)\nEvidence against: Insufficient match in database search to other known CoV spike proteins (Ji et al., 2020)\nStatus: Speculative hypothesis. Unlikely.\nTest: Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will confirm).\nOption 3. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a bioweapon.\nBoth China and the US hinted at the other side\u2019s potential liability in playing a role in bringing about a novel coronavirus in the lab specifically for the purpose of being used as a bioweapon. To add to the intrigue, a Chinese Scientist was released from BSL-4 laboratory in Manitoba, Canada for violating protocols, allegedly sending samples of deadly viruses to mainland China.\nOn January 26, The Washington Times published this article citing an Israeli defense expert claiming that China has likely proceeded with a bioweapons program, but ending the article with a quote to London\u2019s Daily Mail from a US scientist Rutgers University microbiologist Richard Ebright that \u201cat this point there\u2019s no reason to harbor suspicions\u201d that the lab may be linked to the virus outbreak.\nThe same person was quoted in a Feb 2017 Nature article stating that SARS had escaped the Wuhan facility \u201cmultiple times\u201d.\nEvidence for: Presence of BSL-4 laboratory 20 miles from the Wuhan seafood market\nEvidence against: Published opinion.\nStatus: Rumor. But see below. Option 4. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a vaccine.\nIPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378. Here\u2019s a shot of the alignment and the DOT Plot.\nHere\u2019s the nucleotide sequence at NCBI\u2019s Nucleotide database . Here\u2019s a patent for its use in recombination virology.\nThe pShuttle-SN vector was among many described in a 1998 paper by Bert Vogelstein et al; here is a company where one can purchase the pShuttle-SN vector:\nIt turns out that the sequence from pShuttle is most closely related to the Spike protein from SARS coronavirus.\nThis particular technology was used in 2008 to attempt to develop a more immunogenic vaccine against coronavirus. Here\u2019s a Chinese patent for that technique and product intended for use in a vaccine .\nThe patent summary reads:\nSARS vaccine of adenovirus vector and preparation method, application of coronavirus S gene Abstract (translated from Chinese) The present invention belongs to the field of genetic engineering, particularly relates to adenoviral vector SARS vaccines, their preparation and coronavirus S genes in SARS (SARS) on vaccines for the prophylaxis. By means of biological engineering, the coronavirus S gene in combination with deficient recombinant adenovirus, the protective immunogen protein or polypeptide expressed therein, through expansion culture, purification, and formulation to prepare a mucosal immunogenicity can cause the gene vaccine, respiratory mucosal immune response induced by the body to produce antibodies against the virus infection. Specific conditions of the present invention, compared with conventional inactivated virus particle vaccine, safe, easy to use, without limitation intramuscular, have broad clinical applications.\nIn 2015, The US called for an end to research creating new viruses in the lab that have increased threat (higher transmissibility, higher pathogenicity, higher lethalithy) (3)\nThe very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials;\n\u201cAn early concern for application of a SARS-CoV vaccine was the experience with other coronavirus infections which induced enhanced disease and immunopathology in animals when challenged with infectious virus [31], a concern reinforced by the report that animals given an alum adjuvanted SARS vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV exhibited an immunopathologic lung reaction reminiscent of that described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and in animal models given RSV vaccine and challenged naturally (infants) or artificially (animals) with RSV [32], [33]. We and others described a similar immunopathologic reaction in mice vaccinated with a SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [18], [20], [21], [28]. It has been proposed that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is the antigen to which the immunopathologic reaction is directed [18], [21]. Thus, concern for proceeding to humans with candidate SARS-CoV vaccines emerged from these various observations.\u201d \u2013 Tseng et al.,\nThe disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.\nEvidence for: Sequence homology between INS1378 to pShuttle Coronavirus vaccine; presence of a SARS-like Spike protein in bat coronavirus, otherwise most similar to bat coronaviruses; low bootstrap value.\nEvidence against: Low sequence homology (but highly signifiant). NB these viruses are RNA viruses and they can evolve quickly, even under laboratory conditions.\nStatus: Most likely.\nTest: Determine the nucleotide sequence all laboratory types of coronavirus being studied in China (a match will confirm). Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will falsify).\nThe available evidence most strongly supports that the 2019-NCoV virus is a vaccine strain of coronavirus either accidentally released from a laboratory accident, perhaps a laboratory researcher becoming infected with the virus while conducting animal experiments, or the Chinese were performing clinical studies of a Coronavirus vaccine in humans.\nDr. Dale Brown brought to my attention the studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals \u2013 rats, ferrets, and monkeys \u2013 in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus. \u201cCaution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated\u201d- Te et al., 2012 [ Full Text ]\nYasui et al., (2012) reported severe pneumonia in mice who were vaccinated against SARS who were subsequently infected with SARS.\nAnother study of a double-inactived SARS vaccine found increased eosinophilic proinflammatory responses in vaccinated mice, especially older mice, writing:\n\u201cImportantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication.\u201d\nIf the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\nThe implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.\nIn the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. With an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from China to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["China to modernize"], "gensraw_title": [[14582, 285, 3661, 1097]], "probs_title": [[0.02191595733165741, 0.0029102570842951536, 0.000157993781613186, 0.4215683341026306]]}

On the one hand, those hopes were fulfilled with the CR3022, but the four other antibodies, including the synthetic cure m336, created several years ago in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, failed to react to the viral protein.\nThis discovery has greatly surprised the scientists, since computer models did not indicate that slight RBD differences would make the 2019-nCoV invulnerable to those protein molecules. The scientists now study the infected blood samples, in hopes to find other antibodies that would bind with the coronavirus more effectively than the CR3022 does.

ALung has treated numerous COVID-19 patients in the U.S. under existing FDA Emergency Use Provisions, and in the European Union, where the Company is approved having been granted their CE Mark in 2013. The Hemolung\u00ae RAS is currently being used in the FDA approved VENT-AVOID trial for the study of ECCO 2 R in the treatment of Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AE-COPD). In addition, the Hemolung RAS and ECCO 2 R have been studied for the treatment of moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the just concluded UK REST trial, which enrolled 412 patients.\nA public health emergency related to COVID-19 was declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on February 4, 2020. The FDA has issued an EUA for the Hemolung RAS to treat lung failure caused by COVID-19. As indicated in the FDA's EUA letter to ALung, the Hemolung RAS is not FDA-cleared or approved, and there are no FDA-approved or cleared device treatments for lung failure caused by COVID-19. ALung submitted and the FDA reviewed in vitro and in vivo information in support of ALung's ongoing U.S. VENT-AVOID clinical trial for the Hemolung RAS as well as additional information about clinical use of the Hemolung RAS outside the U.S., and additional biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and performance testing.\nBased on the information submitted, the FDA stated that it believes the Hemolung RAS has the potential to treat lung failure as an adjunct to noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, to reduce hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis due to COVID-19, and/or to maintain normalized levels of partial pressure of carbon dioxide(PCO 2 ) and pH in patients suffering from acute, reversible respiratory failure due to COVID-19 for whom ventilation of CO 2 cannot be adequately, safely, or tolerably achieved and, in turn, may provide clinical benefit, and that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the emergency use of the Hemolung RAS to treat lung failure caused by COVID-19.\n\"We are pleased with the FDA's recognition that the Hemolung may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19 by removal of CO 2 directly from the blood during extracorporeal therapy,\" said Mr. Peter M. DeComo, Chairman and CEO of ALung Technologies.\nMr. DeComo further stated, \"With published mortality rates as high as 90% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we believe that the Hemolung can be a valuable tool for physicians to be used in conjunction with IMV, by reducing or eliminating the potential of further lung damage caused by high ventilator driving pressures, often referred to as Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI). Many of the academic medical centers involved with our clinical trial have already requested the use of the Hemolung RAS for treatment of their COVID-19 patients.\"\nAbout ALung Technologies\nALung Technologies, Inc. is a privately held Pittsburgh-based developer and manufacturer of innovative lung assist devices. Founded in 1997 as a spin-out of the University of Pittsburgh, ALung has developed the Hemolung RAS as a dialysis-like alternative or supplement to mechanical ventilation.

Nikki Fields Scott wondered how she\u2019d pay both her mortgage and rent on Old Town Flowers & Gifts. Jonathan Hillyard agonized over which of his four employees, including a brother and niece, he would furlough first if his video production company, Connext Media, didn\u2019t get more orders soon.\n\nLilburn\u2019s commercial core is a microcosm of how the coronavirus is pummeling Main Streets around the nation, threatening to flatten businesses and reverse years of downtown revitalization efforts. An antique shop, sports training academy, martial arts studio, special events space, hair salon and Mexican restaurant closed temporarily in Lilburn, where 10 of 11 small business owners interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said the pandemic has cut their revenue. Gwinnett County small business owners in downtown Lilburn are wrestling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. MATT KEMPNER / AJC\nBut the Gwinnett County community of nearly 13,000 residents is also a petri dish of experiments \u2014 some successful \u2014 as entrepreneurs try to keep their businesses breathing until more customers venture out again. Like the local distillery that switched to making hand sanitizer. Or the farm-to-table restaurant that started selling toilet paper, yeast and bleach. Or the business that, after awful worries, has seen sales surge.\nGov. Brian Kemp is moving aggressively to reopen Georgia\u2019s economy. Everything from hair salons and gyms to bowling alleys and tattoo parlors were allowed to reopen Friday after being ordered shuttered in early April. On Monday, restaurants can reopen dining rooms and movie theaters can resume screenings. And a statewide \u201cshelter in space\u201d order for residents is set to expire after Thursday.\nIt\u2019s too early to tell when the state\u2019s Main Streets will fill up again, or if it will be quick enough that some businesses don\u2019t shutter for good. Public health experts are still cautioning Georgians to avoid close human contact. Businesses that are open must maintain safety measures.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve become absolutely convinced of during this pandemic is that I don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d said Betsey Dahlberg, who owns Hope Springs Distillery with her husband and has had to reinvent the business on the fly.

Downtown shop spaces were rented out. The adjacent city park and greenway attracted crowds for Food Truck Tuesdays and free summer concerts.\nIn recent weeks, crews razed the former municipal court building and police station, making room for a possible play fountain, public gathering space and maybe restaurant. The first of more than 50 planned homes are under construction across the street at the Old Town Lilburn project, including plans for a coffee shop and another restaurant. A development for independent older adults is being built nearby. A new development is underway in downtown Lilburn, but pandemic concerns continue to swirl in Lilburn and around metro Atlanta. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nThe pandemic upturned everything. Events were postponed. Crews fenced off the playground at the city park. Few people strolled by shuttered shops.\nElectrician Allan Cofer, whose family started in the same shop 56 years ago, saw a sudden dip in jobs. Three doors down, insurance agent Dan White said late payments on policies jumped 20%. Contractor Doug Mauk fretted after several construction projects were postponed, some indefinitely.\nAt Old Town Flowers, Scott said she was forced by a city emergency order to close her shop for two weeks, including during the crucial Easter holidays. Restrictions have since loosened but the 62-year-old owner, who learned the business working in her mom\u2019s flower shop, now makes only deliveries. Nikki Fields Scott, at her Old Town Flowers & Gifts, isn\u2019t ready to reopen the downtown Lilburn store to the public. But she is making deliveries. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nShe thinks it\u2019s too early to reopen the store, concerned about the virus. She pours a bit of bleach in water for her flowers, hoping that will reduce the risk. She wears a mask and gloves and leaves the flowers outside customers\u2019 doors.\nScott\u2019s sales were cut in half in recent weeks as people worried about money and pandemic restrictions slowed demand for flowers at funerals and for people at hospitals and nursing homes. She worries about what will happen next month for Mother\u2019s Day, normally her second busiest time after Valentine\u2019s Day.\nHer landlord told her to just pay what rent she can for now. Scott said she paid half what she owed.\n\u201cGod blessed me all through the years,\u201d she said. \u201cEven through this he still blesses me, because I am getting orders.\u201d\nLilburn has offered deferment of some business taxes, and the Downtown Development Authority excused rent for store owners leasing public property.\nHugh Wilkerson, whose wife Rowann owns Antiques in Old Town, helps manage nearby shopping space for another property owner. Four of the five shops there didn\u2019t fully pay last month\u2019s rent, he said, because they had closed during the pandemic.\nThe couple live above their 26-year-old shop on Main Street, in a building that is more than a century old. The shop and its narrow, overflowing aisles closed for more than a month. The couple expect it to survive. Still, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of businesses that probably will never come back,\u201d predicted Wilkerson, who serves on the development authority.\nCharlotte Kelley, co-owner of 97 Main Salon, said customers kept asking in recent weeks to sneak in a back door to have their hair done or get electrolysis to remove hair, a particularly up close procedure. She declined. She also opposed earlier petitions to allow salons to serve a single customer at a time, worrying about safety and logistics.\nNow that salons can reopen under Kemp\u2019s order, she\u2019d still rather not, because she remains worried about safety. But she said she will reopen anyway \u2014 with numerous protections in place \u2014 because her workers need the money and rent is costly. \u201cFinancially we have to do it,\u201d Kelley said.\nHand sanitizer, flour and 3D videos\nAt Hope Springs Distillery earlier this year, Dahlberg, a former attorney, was busy planning a new rose-flavored gin and an elderflower liqueur with her husband, Paul Allen, a former industrial engineer. Now in their third year of business, they had been ahead of schedule, expecting to break even soon.\nInstead, with the arrival of COVID-19, sales runs were called off. Bars closed. Their distributor didn\u2019t reorder cases of the distillery\u2019s vodka, gin and absinthe.\nThe couple quickly decided to make alcohol-based hand sanitizer, including giving some to the city police department. Demand boomed for the eight-ounce bottles at $7 a pop. Early on they sparked a traffic jam down Railroad Avenue and around the corner onto Main Street, requiring police officers to direct the flow.

(ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nAfter 1,500 bottles of sanitizer, the couple is making hundreds more, rationing sales to people who email in advance and get confirmed time slots to stop by.\nStill, overall sales remain down.\n\u201cSome nights it is real hard,\u201d she said. \u201cSome nights I say, \u2018What the hell.\u2019 A lot of people have worse problems.\u201d\nJennifer and Tony Tiberia\u2019s 1910 Public House, a farm-to-table restaurant, had almost no delivery or takeout sales before the pandemic struck. They went from Friday and Saturday nights with typical hour-plus waits to worrying about how they could make payroll, which can hit $65,000 a month between their two restaurants, including Sprig in Decatur.\nFirst, they consolidated menus, shortened operating hours and devised more family-oriented meals for takeout. Then they became mini-grocers after realizing customers needed products hard to find in grocery stores but available through restaurant suppliers. Among the offerings: paper towels, latex gloves, flour and uncooked ground beef and chicken breasts. 1910 Public House owners Jennifer (left) and Tony Tiberia pose for a photo inside their restaurant in downtown Lilburn. They\u2019ve had to keep shifting the business to deal with the pandemic and metro Atlantans\u2019 concerns about public gatherings. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nThe restaurant\u2019s sales are off by 50%, but many staffers are getting shifts again, including former waiters making deliveries.\nBefore the coronavirus, Tiberia had planned to open a coffee shop and another restaurant across Main Street. But she\u2019s having second thoughts, worried that consumers will be slow to return to eating near strangers.\nWhile Kemp\u2019s order permits the resumption of in-dining, the couple has leaned toward staying focused on takeout, but allowing people who pick up their meals to eat them on an outdoor patio, with no waiter present.\nMecredy, who owns MOMS, had to stop holding concerts in his backyard amphitheater. The first show of the season was supposed to be Saturday. It\u2019s unclear when concerts will resume; live entertainment venues still aren\u2019t allowed to reopen.\nMecredy, though, who opened his business nine years ago, was stunned that 80% of MOMS students taking music lessons agreed to switch to online classes. That has kept the enterprise afloat. Scott Mecredy, owner of Music on Main Street, poses for a photo outside the business in downtown Lilburn. He was amazed so many parents were willing to try a new way to have their kids stick with music lessons and were anxious to help keep the business afloat. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nJonathan Hillyard is one of the few \u2014 if not the only \u2014 business owners in downtown Lilburn who can claim rising sales amid the pandemic. His three-year-old Connext Media was mostly focused on serving local real estate agents, and he worried he would have to furlough staff.\nBut while some work dried up, Hillyard said he saw an even bigger surge from real estate agents interested in 3D virtual tours of homes. With open houses and showings put on hold, the videos offered prospective homebuyers another way to look inside. Business at his video production company jumped 30% in one month, he said.\nHe knows others haven\u2019t been as fortunate. He said his mother was laid off from a job after 30 years at a home d\u00e9cor showroom inside AmericasMart. She got a week\u2019s severance. His drive to work is also eye-opening.\nThe scene in downtown Lilburn has been \u201ckind of eerie.\u201d For many businesses, he added,\u201ceverything is on pause.\u201d In downtown Lilburn, 1910 Public House restaurant server/bartender Greg Thompson prepares a curbside pickup of a customer order: a meal and grocery staples such as toilet paper.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is calling this a global threat and all 31 provinces in China now have confirmed reports of positive cases. As many as 51 million Chinese are reported to be under quarantine. Beijing said there are at least 9,692 people confirmed to have the infection. Another 102,000 people were also reportedly under medical observation with possible symptoms of the respiratory ailment.\nMore countries are now evacuating their citizens from China and in Australia racial tension is at breaking point.\nWhat is SA doing to help its citizens trapped in China? According to CNN, South Africans in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel Corons virus outbreak, have expressed frustration about their government\u2019s lack of evacuation plans from the city.South African Pieter Viljoen, who traveled with a colleague to Wuhan for a business conference before the city\u2019s transport lockdown began, said the a uthorities in South Africa and its embassy in Beijing had not provided support or information about plans to repatriate them.South Africa\u2019s embassy in Beijing also declined to help when his company made private arrangements to secure a flight to get them out of the country and requested assistance and documentation to begin their evacuation process, he says. Dozens of South Africans are caught in the city\u2019s lock down had also complained about the South African government\u2019s lack of communication in a WeChat group created to share information about the situation. Airlines around the world are suspending flights to China as the Corona virus spreads across the globe. \u201cWe are not getting any real assistance. The only information from the South African embassy is that we must comply with local authorities. In terms of leaving Wuhan, there has been no effort or communication about evacuation,\u201d Viljoen said. He toll CNN News that he had remained in his hotel, which has shut down operations partially since the movement restriction put in place to help check the spread of the deadly virus. Supermarkets and grocery stores around his hotel in Wuhan\u2019s Optics Valley area are running out of supplies, he said. \u201cYou have only these small supermarkets where you can get food right now because of the complete lock down. You can\u2019t move around from one district to another, so supplies are not readily available,\u201d Viljoen told CNN on telephone. South Africa\u2019s embassy in Beijing declined to comment on Viljoen\u2019s allegations and directed CNN\u2019s request for comment to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO). The embassy had closed on January 26 for the Lunar New Year holiday and full operations only resumed Thursday, according to DIRCO . Emergency contact numbers manned by embassy staff were available for citizens in need of assistance to call during the holiday, the department added. (But according to those trying to phone, the phones remain unanswered.) DIRCO spokesman, Clayson Monyela, told CNN on Thursday that the South African government and its health ministry were working on all requests. However, they must also consider travel and quarantine measures imposed by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. \u201cWe are not ignoring their plight, and we are quite aware of the need for speed to assist our citizens in Wuhan. We are liaising with the mission in Beijing to see how we can respond to the situation within the present context,\u201d Monyela said. South Africa\u2019s opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which said it was in touch with more than 100 South Africans in China, called on the foreign ministry to address the \u201cdysfunction\u201d at the county\u2019s embassy in China, which it said had affected efforts to help stranded citizens. DA ABroad is now assisting South Africans. Uncertain future Despite growing calls for repatriation, South Africa\u2019s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said there were no plans to fly its citizens out as Chinese authorities have the outbreak under control. \u201cThe Chinese government has assured us that there is no evidence to necessitate the evacuation of foreign nationals living in Wuhan city, and they have called for calm in this respect,\u201d Mkhize said. He added that they have been assured by the Chinese government that foreign nationals who fall sick will be treated in the same way as Chinese citizens. South African Jessika Bailing says she feels neglected by her country\u2019s government. The 23-year-old English teacher, who moved from South Africa to Wuhan last year, said while many countries are racing to get their citizens out of the city, authorities in South Africa were reluctant to make such arrangements. \u201cI\u2019ve watched other countries\u2019 governments go above and beyond to evacuate their citizens and then we are faced with that kind of response from our government, how can one not feel abandoned?\u201d Bailing said. \u201cThe South African government may be putting things into place or trying to find some solutions to get the South Africans in Wuhan evacuated but neither me nor any other South African I have been in contact with feels that they are,\u201d she added. Dustin Emslie says he\u2019s disappointed by the South African government\u2019s response to the situation. \u201cI didn\u2019t really expect the government to evacuate us, I just hoped there would be more concern for South African citizens abroad,\u201d he said. Emslie, who has lived in Wuhan for six years, said he would leave with his Chinese wife and 3-year-old daughter, only if the whole family will go. \u201cIf I had to leave, it would only be if they could come with me to South Africa. There is no way I\u2019m just going to abandon them here,\u201d he said. He said while locals and expatriates had been trying to cope with the restrictions, the uncertainty about when the lock down will end had been the hardest to bear. \u201cWe have no idea when this epidemic will end. It could be months that we are under lock down here in Wuhan,\u201d he wrote in a text message.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["The Konyo"], "gensraw_title": [[465, 510, 1648, 79]], "probs_title": [[0.09683538228273392, 0.0002878517552744597, 0.00635008467361331, 0.017417320981621742]]}

A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.\nThere is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.\nThe symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu\u2014fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.\nCorona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.\nSo, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection\u2014corona virus included. I would check that off the list.\nFirst, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.\nMost people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.\nIf you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.\nFor vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)\nAlso, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.\nIodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.\nAs I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can\u2019t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.\nThe RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.\nTo prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion.\nFinally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration\u2014drink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.\nConventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your hands\u2013I agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.\nAs for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It won\u2019t help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)\nMy last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide.

Can people get sick from these corona viruses from our pets?\u201d J.S., Kansas City, MO.\nA: That\u2019s a great question, let\u2019s begin here. A vaccine is available to prevent canine coronavirus infection in the first place. This vaccine may be included in combination vaccines that also protects dogs from the typically more serious canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV-2), and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2). In cats, the corona virus itself is so benign that typically people see no symptoms, and if they do, typically it\u2019s minor gastro-intestinal upset which goes away in a day or so without treatment.\nOne of the world\u2019s experts on this topic is Dr. Niels Pedersen, legendary professor emeritus University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. He says, \u201cThe simple answer is that feline and canine coronaviruses do not infect humans and vice versa. Humans have their own genetically distinct types of coronaviruses. However, cross species transfer does occur, but only after significant mutation and over many years, centuries and millennia. Therefore, it is possible that a coronavirus originating in a cat or dog could mutate and enter humans and cause disease in the future. if it does, it will become a human virus and no longer a cat or dog virus.\n\u201cThe more complex answer goes like this: Coronaviruses have adapted themselves by mutation over a period of 50,000 years or more to virtually every species of animal, including humans. They only cause disease in their new species and tend to remain in that species in whatever genetic form that allowed adapt to their new hosts. The various coronaviruses have been sequenced and their relationship to each other determined. The common cold-causing coronaviruses of humans (OC43, 229E and NL63) are in the alphacoronavirus group, along with the coronavirus of cats (and dogs).\n\u201cThe more recently humanized strains of coronavirus, MERS, SARS and Wuhan, have jumped over from the Betacoronaviruses of bats, possibly by intermediate infection of other animals such as camels and civet cats. There is absolutely no evidence that viruses with strong genetic relationship to the coronaviruses of cats and dogs transmit back and forth between animal and human. However, the tendency for coronaviruses to jump species is an ongoing and future problem and a dog or cat coronavirus may enter humans and cause disease sometime in the future, but if it does, it will no longer be a cat or dog virus, but rather a new human virus. \u201c", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Can a Dog or Cat\u2019s Coronavirus Give You the Flu?"], "gensraw_title": [[6091, 258, 8533, 394, 5182, 448, 248, 83, 2745, 262, 616, 19398, 13787, 922, 263, 34071, 31, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.3066706955432892, 0.026463426649570465, 0.5846933722496033, 0.4171988070011139, 0.8700730204582214, 0.010476913303136826, 0.9999468326568604, 0.9995844960212708, 0.3299938142299652, 0.7526739239692688, 0.9947750568389893, 0.9984024167060852, 0.016965391114354134, 0.8255793452262878, 0.49705174565315247, 0.9208941459655762, 0.9764118194580078, 0.9878567457199097]]}

As uncertainty looms about fall semester, many colleges are exploring budget reductions and personnel cuts.\nAs uncertainty over fall semesters looms, the coronavirus pandemic already has cost Ohio colleges hundreds of millions of dollars, sparking conversations about hiring freezes, possible furloughs and other budget reduction measures.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has cost Ohio\u2019s 14 public universities between $290 million and $310 million this fiscal year, said Bruce Johnson, president of the Inter-University Council of Ohio, an association of the state\u2019s public universities. That includes a combined $171 million in refunds to students, primarily for room and board costs and some fees. Ramping up of online learning has also accounted for costs.\nColleges and universities are still considering what these financial ramifications will mean for them and how they might respond.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at paring down their staffs first, to respond to what we think is a pretty traumatic new normal,\u201d Johnson said.\nThere is also lost revenue for such things as renting out campus space for conferences and summer camps, he said.\nOhio State University\u2019s housing, dining and recreational fee refunds totaled more than $35 million, and the university expects continued volatility related to investment returns, Michael Papadakis, senior vice president of business and finance and chief financial officer at OSU, said in a written statement.\nFor the next fiscal year, Ohio State has asked all colleges and units to prepare three budget scenarios: assuming 5%, 10% and 20% reductions in spending.\n\u201cWe must prepare for fiscal 2021 based on the possibility of ongoing disruptions while continuing to focus on the university\u2019s core academic mission and placing Ohio State in the best possible position for a future in which the virus is contained,\u201c Papadakis said.\nOhio State has already enacted a hiring freeze, which is expected to save $4 million to $6 million through June 30, and paused certain salary increases, which could save the university $5 million to $10 million. OSU also has paused a number of capital projects.\nAs the university envisions various budget scenarios, the OSU chapter of American Association of University Professors called last week for transparency in financial planning, with a focus on teaching and research. Members also asked that budget decisions prioritize people such as adjunct faculty and graduate students who aren\u2019t protected by tenure.\n\u201cThe most vulnerable shouldn\u2019t pay for the budget crisis,\u201d said Pranav Jani, an AAUP board member and an associate professor of English.\nMeanwhile, the University of Cincinnati announced earlier this month hiring and salary freezes, spending cuts and pay cuts to the university\u2019s leadership team.\nAnd last week, University of Akron President Gary Miller asked the athletics department and all non-academic administrative divisions to present plans for reducing expenditures by 20%. He also asked university leaders to present a plan to reorganize the academic division and reduce the number of colleges and programs.\nPrivate colleges are also game-planning for financial struggles. Urbana University announced last week that it will close after this semester, due to ongoing enrollment challenges and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nC. Todd Jones, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio, doesn\u2019t expect more Ohio private colleges to close in the short term, but he said hiring freezes are already in place at many, and other cuts are likely coming.\n\u201cAs this continues, colleges are having to look at potential furloughs because when you look at what does college cost, colleges costs are driven by people,\u201d Jones said.\nOhio Wesleyan University is projecting a $2.9 million deficit for this fiscal year ending June 30 and had already forecast another $7.5 million deficit for 2020-2021, thanks in part to construction debt, OWU spokesman Cole Hatcher said in a written statement. But because of the pandemic, next year\u2019s projected deficit has increased to a worst-case scenario of $11 million to $12 million.\nThe private liberal arts college in Delaware, Ohio, already was reviewing ways to cut costs, Hatcher said. Those efforts will continue through the fall and could result in consolidating work, updating technology, and some job cuts and early retirement options, he said.\nFederal relief arrives, but state cuts loom\nThe federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed last month included billions in aid for higher education. Ohio institutions received a combined $388 million among its public and private colleges, community colleges, career academies, technical schools, adult education centers and cosmetology schools.\nHalf of the funds must go to students through emergency grants, while universities may use the other half to cover costs associated with the coronavirus.\nFor Ohio\u2019s public colleges, the federal aid totaled nearly $200 million, with $100 million going to students for emergency relief. The other nearly $100 million doesn\u2019t cover the full losses that public universities have suffered due to the pandemic, Johnson said.\nAs the federal aid comes in, Ohio colleges are bracing for cuts at the state level. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked state agencies to prepare to make cuts of up to 20% as state tax revenues fall due to lost jobs and closed businesses.\nDeWine has not yet announced details about possible cuts, but Johnson said public colleges are concerned about cuts to the State Share of Instruction, Ohio\u2019s primary mechanism for subsidizing instructional costs.\n\u201cWe\u2019d be extremely concerned if we lost the already $290 million and then on top of that, the state were forced to cut higher education,\u201d Johnson said.\nPrivate colleges, meanwhile, don\u2019t receive that direct state support, but they worry about state cuts to need-based financial aid for students, such as the Ohio College Opportunity Grant, which recently saw an increase in funding.\nWhat\u2019s to come\nThe future is murky as colleges try to plan for autumn.\n\u201cI would call it apprehensive,\u201d Jones said of the outlook for fall semesters. \u201cBecause our colleges do not know what\u2019s going to transpire, and yet they need to be prepared for a variety of different scenarios of what could happen.\u201d\nCurrently, the state\u2019s public universities are planning for students and faculty to be back on campus come fall, but they are also planning for other outcomes, Johnson said.\nOhio State\u2019s AAUP asked the university for \u201ctimely notice\u201d of changes for the fall term.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to know too much in advance, but to have a couple or three game plans that might play out\u201d would be helpful, said AAUP board member and OSU associate professor of English Jill Galvan, noting that faculty, staff and students should be involved in the decision-making.\nThere\u2019s no set timeline or date by which public colleges plan to make a decision about the fall, Johnson said, and each university will handle decisions on its own.\n\u201cWe certainly want to give parents and students good information in May,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal.\"\nIf students aren\u2019t back on campus this fall, private universities will struggle, Jones said.\n\u201cIf this pandemic continues and colleges are not able to reopen their dorms and resume some semblance of normal enrollment this fall, that could endanger a number of campuses,\u201d he said.\n", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["The Coronav"], "gensraw_title": [[465, 2745, 262, 616]], "probs_title": [[0.10734079033136368, 0.2343408316373825, 0.9981718063354492, 0.9992274045944214]]}

We returned home from China on January 15th. We had a wonderful six months there - and were home ready to continue onto the next adventure. But the last two weeks have been sort of a let down. After all that excitement and the Corona Virus thing - we are relieved that we dodged the bullet physically. But the mental let down has left me with writer's block - and an extreme sadness for the Chinese people. I have to start this story in 1998. I had prostate cancer and had my prostate removed. If you have had cancer - you know the scare of staring the grim reaper in the face - it is not pretty. Lulu insisted that I have my surgery at Sloan Kettering in New York City - the best. They took a full body x-ray to see if the cancer spread to other parts of my body. That proved extremely important later on. I had my prostate removed and life went on. In 2003 - I retired from teaching. Just as I was ready to celebrate retirement - during a routine lung x-ray - a spot appeared on my lung. It was an up and down roller coaster - from the highest high to the lowest low. We had more tests and waited weeks which seemed like years for the results. The results were a 1 cm circular nodule on the upper right lung - a daughter cell from my former cancer I thought. It looked like my retirement would be very short. Lulu arranged a big retirement celebration for me. We went back to the doctor. He said - if only we had an old x-ray. Right away we thought of Sloan Kettering. We sent for my full body x-ray. Eureka! There is was. On the old x-ray - you could see the tiny nodule. My doctor said I probably had tuberculosis many many years ago. It was an old healed scar. Because it was perfectly round - and lasted so long - it was NOT cancer. Lulu took me here to be treated for a bacterial lung infection Flash forward to Beijing China. For Thanksgiving - our friend Melissa came to visit. We both had this horrible cough that seemed to be caused by the air pollution. We were both eating Ricola lozenges like candy. They provided some cough relief. The cough persisted - all day and night. Remember this was right before the Corona Virus scare. One day Lulu just called a cab and took me to the hospital. I coughed my way into Peking University People's Hospital. They triaged me to the Infectious Disease Clinic. I was in a waiting room of maybe 40 people. The Clinic did a blood test - chest x-ray - took my temperature and blood pressure - and then I went right in to see the doctor. She told me that I had a bacterial infection in my lung. She said it was not contagious. She said I could have an IV antibiotic or oral medication. I took the pills because I wanted to get out of there right away. All that medical treatment cost $60! I paid cash on the spot and they gave me the antibiotic right there. We went back to the apartment and I cleared right up in a few days. The doctor also noticed a spot on my lungs. She was concerned and told me to get a CT-scan once we were back in America. That should have set off a previous alarm bell from back in 2003 - but it didn't. Instead we worried - that I had some other disease. Lulu decided that we would spend Christmas with the whole family in Paris. It would provide some warm weather for me - and some much needed \"family battery recharge.\" She also included a week in Spain on the Med Sea. To Lulu - Christmas does not exist without family. We returned to China in time to complete Lulu's Fulbright Scholarship. We left China on January 15th - because that was the day our Residence Visa expired. We were cutting it close and any delay would have put us in the slammer. We went from Paris to Peking to Seattle to Atlanta to Tallahassee in 48 hours. We sailed \u00be the way around the world. Because of tickets and obligations we had to take that long way home. When we got home we were greeted by the Corona Virus Scare. We were coming from China and CNN was running constant news that \"we were all gonna die.\" I was carrying a spot in my lung and had to go see my doctor. Dr Hartsfield took me right away. He put my mind at ease. I bought a new thermometer and was taking my temperature every hours. I had not broken 98.1. He said - with no fever - my chances are low to having Corona. Yes - I am to the familiarity level of calling it by its first name. He scheduled an x-ray - with the memo \"recent pneumonia\" - to speed it up. When I got to the x-ray clinic - and I said I was in China for six months - they literally started spraying and holding my papers with tweezers. Even the pretty women technicians - were taking a step back from me. I have spots all over my body where they were touching me with ten foot poles! Now they had me scared. The doctor reported that he saw the spot on my lung. Uh-oh! I was already wondering how many people would show up for my funeral. He said I would have a CT-scan right away. By the time of the CT-scan - my looks must have improved - because those attendants treated me like normal - although I was in and out of there in 5 minutes. The doctor asked me if I have any old CT-scans to compare it to you. Then I remembered - the OLD x-rays from New York City - Coaldale - and Reading. I told the doctor of the x-rays and CT-scans from back when I cancer in 1998. I told the doctor I had a 1 cm circular nodule scar on my upper right lung in 2003. He said we will wait for the x-rays from up north - but he said you still have a 1 cm circular nodular scar on your upper right lung. :-) Lulu original applied to go to Wuhan University for her Fulbright Scholarship. They have the top library science school in China. But at the last minute - Fulbright decided we would go to Beijing. We wanted the Wuhan warm weather - but Beijing has so much more to see and do. We were lucky. With the Corona Virus - we would be quarantined there now. We would have been there until Jan 30th. With all the news about Corona Virus - people have been asking me how we are. It is hard to rank the best times of your life - but our China visit is easily in the Top 10. We loved our time there and love the people of China. China is such a Giant country - 1.3 billion people. They have giant problems with air pollution - water pollution - sewage disposal - and now Corona Virus. In the 70 years of the government - they have never been at war. They have made great strides in economy and production. The people have wonderful attitude and work hard. I finish this story exhausted. After six months of constant on the go - the last two weeks at home have been heaven. We appreciate the clean water and air. We love going to Sonnys BBQ for supper. Shopping at Publix for food is heavenly. Having supper 4 nights straight at 4 different friends' houses is nice. Watching 4 FSU basketball games in a week is cool. Adjusting to jet lag in your own home and bed is divine. I did not even mention I gained 5 pounds in China. Yes - I am having a little let down and writer's block. I am so the thankful for Lulu and everything I have. By the way - did I tell you - I have a 1 cm circular nodule on my upper right lung for 25 years.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["As I Enter the"], "gensraw_title": [[1723, 315, 6063, 263]], "probs_title": [[0.002076254691928625, 0.10091358423233032, 0.007149983197450638, 0.16753001511096954]]}

Multiple virology laboratories around the world have basically confirmed that the fingerprint of genetic modification vectors is unmistakably present in this coronavirus gene sequence. In other words, the remnants of gene-engineering tools for the genetic insertion are still present in virus samples. One of the first laboratories to discover this was a top research institute in India called the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences. Their analysis of the RNA sequence revealed that part of the HIV virus was inserted into this coronavirus. Notably, the appearance of any aspect of the HIV virus in another coronavirus has never occurred before. Such a discovery is analogous to finding a jackalope.\nThe mythical mash-up jackalope and the Wuhan coronavirus share some commonalities. This particular HIV segment allows it to better plug into the mucus membranes of the human system, giving it a rare entry mechanism not found in any other coronavirus. Scientists in other laboratories worldwide, including a well-known virologist in Beijing, China, point out that this coronavirus has been unmistakably human engineered. He mentions a SARS binding protein sequence that also allows it entry into human cells. The same scientist points out that at this time of the year no bats are sold or found at the Wuhan seafood market. Forty-five percent of the initial people who came down with the virus had not visited the Wuhan seafood market, clearly showing that the speculation that the virus spread through the Wuhan seafood market is completely bogus. It is interesting to note that a variety of virology laboratories from different countries have confirmed that this virus is human engineered.\nThough my initial intuition was that the virus had accidentally escaped from the Wuhan laboratory located 20 miles away from the marketplace, the virus was not found in a bat in the marketplace. This has been more seriously validated in the last 48 hours. It is also my interpretation that the weaponized virus was accidentally released at this time. It's important to understand that viruses have legitimately accidentally been released from laboratories in a variety of unexpected ways. Historically, there may be close to 10 virus research laboratories in the US, alone, where this has happened. The question that humanity must answer is,\n\"Why are we manufacturing human lethal bioweapons in the level 3 and 4 research centers around the world?\"\nNot only have we demonstrated our inability to handle them in ways that don't prevent accidental releases, but the very idea of creating these lethal bioweapons is antithetical to the great, moral, and ethical wisdom and Biblical teachings. Going against the divine purpose of life is going against God. At some point we need to stop this insane behavior from continuing.\nJust because this virus is lab-grown, doesn't mean we shouldn't take it seriously. On the contrary it is crucial that we meet exposure with an enhanced health regime and protocol.\nTo protect and enhance our natural immunity, I want to add several items to my Wuhan Coronavirus Protection Protocol:\nIllumodine - 20 drops in a glass of water 3 times daily (15 minutes or more away from food) (Iodine has been shown to destroy SARS and MRSA viruses and, in its atomic form [Illumodine] is probably the most powerful antiviral on the planet.)

In many parts of the world, the COVID-19 public health crisis has stressed the health care system close to or even past its breaking point. Hospital resources are focused on the immediate needs of patients suffering from the disease, particularly those who are critically ill. The strain on health care systems and the need to control the virus using containment and mitigation has impacted the care of patients with other common medical disorders. Clinicians have been forced to balance the risk of delaying potentially necessary exams against the risk of exposing patients to the virus in hospital settings or exposing health care workers to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. This is further complicated by the re-allocation of resources, including hospital personnel, to evaluate and treat patients with COVID-19.\n\"The potential risk of exposure or transmission during routine care, as well as the diversion of resources to help combat the pandemic, has forced clinicians to make decisions about the timing of care,\" said Peter J. Mazzone, M.D., M.P.H., FCCP, director of the Lung Cancer Program and Lung Cancer Screening Program for the Cleveland Clinic Respiratory Institute. \"This document provides guidance that we hope will help with these decisions. It outlines acceptable variances from standard practice during the pandemic and provides items to consider that could influence the decisions for a given patient.\"\nPerforming a lung cancer screening exam or the evaluation of lung nodules both carry additional risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is added risk to the patient, other patients and health care providers from exposure to the health care environment and the contact that occurs during testing. Recovery from surgical resection may be influenced by asymptomatic carriage of the virus. These added risks may upset the balance of benefit and harm struck by current (pre-COVID) guideline recommendations. There is also a shift in health care resources, toward canceling elective procedures and imaging, in areas where\nCOVID-19 is surging, or where systems are preparing for a surge, making it more difficult to adhere to available guidelines. These exposure risks and resource constraints have led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to suggest that non-urgent care be deferred.\nTo date, clinicians and hospital systems have been independently determining how to modify their screening and lung nodule management programs during the pandemic. The consensus statement was developed to provide expert opinion to clinicians regarding the performance of lung cancer screening and the management of patients with lung nodules in a manner that is consistent with current CDC COVID-19 guidance. Three project leaders and 21 panel members participated in developing the consensus statement. Their specialties included pulmonology, thoracic radiology and thoracic surgery. Twelve scenarios were developed, each with a statement requiring a vote. The voting results for all statements exceeded the threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree. Scenarios recommendations and notes are included in the report.\nConsensus was unanimous for recommendations to delay baseline or repeat annual screening, and over 95% of panelists agreed to delay the evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected incidentally or by screening that have a low probability of cancer or are likely to be an indolent cancer.\nConsensus was less uniform but still strong for recommendations to delay or modify the evaluation and management of patients with nodules measuring greater than 8 millimeters in average diameter.\nThe authors note that these recommendations are not \"one-size-fits-all\" and state that patient preferences should be considered in all of the scenarios, because individual patients are likely to differ in how they perceive the potential benefits and harms associated with delayed or modified evaluation and management.\nThe paper points out that due to the fluidity of the situation, it is not possible at this time to determine when it will be advisable to return to usual care practices.\n\"We hope these statements are helpful and provide some reassurance and direction to individuals who are eligible for lung cancer screening, patients with lung nodules, and the clinicians who care for them,\" the authors conclude.\nRSNA is committed to connecting radiologists and the radiology community to the most timely and useful COVID-19 information and resources.

The findings are published early online in the Journal of Medical Virology .\nThe study notes that patients who became infected with the virus were exposed to wildlife animals at a wholesale market, where seafood, poultry, snakes, bats, and farm animals were sold.\nBy conducting a detailed genetic analysis of the virus and comparing it with available genetic information on different viruses from various geographic locations and host species, the investigators concluded that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a virus that formed from a combination of a coronavirus found in bats and another coronavirus of unknown origin.

Such recognition is key to allowing viruses to enter host cells, which can lead to infection and disease.\nFinally, the team uncovered evidence that the 2019-nCoV likely resided in snakes before being transmitted to humans. Recombination within the viral receptor-binding protein may have allowed for cross-species transmission from snake to humans.\n\u201cResults derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest for the first time that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cNew information obtained from our evolutionary analysis is highly significant for effective control of the outbreak caused by the 2019-nCoV-induced pneumonia.\u201d\nWith this evidence, mitigation measures can be put in place to prevent future occurrences of the 2019-nCov.\nReference: \u201cHomologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross\u2010species transmission from snake to human\u201d by Wei Ji, Wei Wang, Xiaofang Zhao, Junjie Zai and Xingguang Li, 22 January 2020 , Journal of Medical Virology .", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["China Is Battling a New Virus Now, And It's Contagious"], "gensraw_title": [[14582, 1149, 12351, 1360, 258, 969, 40585, 2736, 12, 844, 633, 339, 2346, 364, 700, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.015055177733302116, 0.08626488596200943, 0.027052611112594604, 0.9970977306365967, 0.6036351323127747, 0.8503260612487793, 0.12914372980594635, 0.0021426298189908266, 0.20022310316562653, 0.2168995589017868, 0.47225478291511536, 0.284122496843338, 0.011365300975739956, 0.5235875248908997, 0.984245240688324, 0.4209034740924835]]}

It is a concerted effort being taken by our different agencies, to ensure that an outbreak is avoided.\nThe Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) has advised local government units to create their respective Coronavirus Task Force to contain the spread of the disease at the local level.\nThe said Task Force will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and gadgets; that local health workers are trained in the prevention, control, and containment of the coronavirus; and that those suspected of nCoV are referred and transported to Department of Health (DOH)- designated-coronavirus referral center or hospitals.\nLGUs are also tasked to conduct information campaigns regarding the virus as well post public advisories and preventive measures the public can take.\nThe Department of Education (DepEd) likewise, continues to promote awareness regarding the virus in schools and immediate communities through information materials from DOH. DepEd has also expanded the work of its Taal Quick Response and Recovery Team to include the nCoV matter.\nThe Department of Transportation and its attached agencies have implemented safety protocols as early as January 23. It has been closely coordinating with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) to support in securing transport terminals and in monitoring arriving passengers.\nTo contain the spread of nCoV, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has reactivated its communicable disease preparedness procedures on all CAAP-operated airports, especially those with international flights.\nAirport frontline personnel have been advised to follow precautionary measures, to exercise extreme vigilance in handling passenger arrivals, and to strictly monitor those who may be infected by the virus.\nThe Civil Aviation Board (CAB), meanwhile, resolved to immediately and indefinitely suspend all air services operations between Wuhan and any point in the Philippines.\nTo make certain the safety of public land transportation, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has mandated all public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and conductors to wear face masks at all times and have asked franchise holders to ensure compliance. Terminal operators were also directed to ensure proper sanitation and provide face masks and disinfectants or sanitizer for free, for passengers to use.\nThe Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) issued an advisory on January 23 which advises ship owners and operators to take the necessary measures to monitor the 2019-nCoV and to report suspected cases of nCoV. Ship owners and operators were also asked to install necessary medical equipment and to equip their personnel with full information about the virus.\nThe MARINA has put in place monitoring procedures such as body temperature tests for people entering its building, wearing of masks for its frontline personnel, and the provision of alcohol dispensers at its entrances and comfort rooms. Its premises are also being regularly sanitized.\nIn order to keep the public informed, the PCOO has also activated its Laging Handa communications team to provide information and updates from government agencies regarding the 2019-nCoV through all government media platforms.\nThese measures are all being undertaken by various government agencies to contain the spread of the virus. We enjoin the public to be vigilant and conscientious, and to work with the authorities and follow their prescribed procedures and precautionary measures.

Even as a vegetarian today smelling the hypnotic smell of its potent fragrance, with in conjunction to the sound of its sizzling patterns from the frying pan can send me straight into a frenzy storming out the front of any kitchen door in extreme frustration, weak in temptation, and fully engaged in a conscious battle between the unhealthy devil on the left side of my shoulder and the little angel full of life and vitality on the right.\nNonetheless, in today\u2019s time I\u2019ve more so been wondering why haven\u2019t so many other minorities and people with comprised immunity\u2019s haven\u2019t switched over to a meatless diet with less salt and starch? Especially with the media constantly announcing the heightened risk of limited survival of Covid-19 for those with comprised or weak immune systems. There are a number of things we can do to boost our immunity, one that doesn\u2019t get a lot of widespread media is fasting, fasting rebuilds and regenerates cells, fasting adds years on your life, fasting also detoxify\u2019s the body and blood, and is also known for curing and riding the body of all kinds of illness\u2019es and diseases. I\u2019m going on my second year of fasting, some would call my methods of fasting extreme as I like to fast generally twice a month on periods of 5 day increments. If you find this to be a bit much (because it is in the beginning) I definitely had my fair share of trail and errors, you can try intermediate fasting, which one example is leaving a 8 hour window open for meals with hours consisting of 1 pm -9 pm and using the rest of the 16 hours of your day to fast. The beautiful thing about fasting is it\u2019s versatility, you can incorporate any type of method to your fast you\u2019d like!\nAlso, another great tip on building up immunity is incorporating essential oils into your daily regime, eucalyptus, frankincense, and oregano are some of the top essentials oils for reducing inflammation, extensive scientific study\u2019s have found a direct link between Frankincense\u2019s ability to lower inflammation and an enhanced immunity.\nInflammation is just your body\u2019s way of formulating illness. Heart disease, and respiratory infections are all just a over flow of inflammation to those specific parts of the body, even dementia is caused by inflammation in the brain. Eucalyptus might be my fave out of all three, not only does it provide instant relief, but it also provides a soothing calming effect especially good for balancing better sleep patterns. The secret to its effectiveness is a compound called 1, 8-cineole, which has powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, and anti-bacterial properties. Oregano is just as powerful as it is a natural antibiotic, it also lowers cholesterol, and it also known for its ability to prevent cold symptoms from worsening. Balancing a healthy diet full of vitamin c is also in essential in balancing immunity. Believe it or not I haven\u2019t had a cold in close to 4 years! Long before this pandemic I\u2019ve incorporated protecting my hands when touching public doors and gas pumps etc.\nHolistic healing is somewhat something that is whispered amongst the African American Community, mainly due to the media and big pharmaceutical company\u2019s ideology\u2019s against it.

Disparate impact layoffs claims\nFor many companies, layoffs and downsizing will be unavoidable in the comping months. What can be avoided, though, is claims of discrimination, if such layoffs are carefully and prudently planned.\n\u201dAs companies address the need for layoffs and furloughs, the disparate impact of decisions on who is retained and who is terminated will face scrutiny, opening the door to possible claims for age discrimination,\u201d Schmidt writes. 5. Employee medical privacy claims\nOne of your team members notifies you that they\u2019ve tested positive for COVID-19. What do you do? Do you share this information publicly with the rest of their team so they\u2019re aware of their own exposure? How you handle employees\u2019 medical information will undoubtedly come under careful scrutiny in the coming months.\n\u201cEmployee privacy claims are likely to follow as the manner in which companies handle sensitive information concerning employees\u2019 medical diagnosis is questioned,\u201d Schmidt writes. \u201cThis includes internal as well as external reporting. If employee records, normally maintained on a secured server, are accessed and stored outside of the normal environment, there are risks relating to unauthorized access to private information and resulting privacy claims.\u201d 4. ERISA claims\n401(k) plans have taken a major hit across the board, and some people will be wondering if their advisors should have been doing more to protect them against the loss. \u201cAny down market prompts greater scrutiny of past fiduciary decisions,\u201d Writes Schmidt, pointing to the impact that the recent verdict in Retirement Plans Committee of IBM v. Jander, will have. 3. Employee safety and claims\n\u201cCompanies have been required to balance urgent business needs with employee health and safety during the crisis,\u201d Schmidt writes. \u201cThere will likely be class actions relating to exposures to the virus in the workplace. In addition, the stress of the pandemic and resulting mental health needs will increase the likelihood of individual as well as class claims.\u201d 2. Wage & hour claims\nWith the sudden and unplanned switch to work-from-home arrangements, many companies may not have had time to adequately spell out policies and expectations for employees.\nWrites Schmidt: \u201cAs a result of employees working remotely, standard operating procedures and controls relating to meal and rest breaks have been disrupted. A lack of adequate recordkeeping and oversight increases the risk of wage and hour claims, including overtime pay. The use of personal equipment for business purposes triggers questions and claims relating to companies\u2019 reimbursement policies.\u201d Advertisement 1. WARN Act claims\nThe Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires employers with at least 100 full-time workers who are laying off at least 50 workers during a 30-day period (\u201cPlant closing\u201d) to provide at least 60 days\u2019 notice before layoffs. But given the sudden shift in the economy and the mandatory closure or slowdown of businesses, as well as the day-to-day development related to coronavirus, 60 days is more than man employers can spare.\n\u201dThe announcement of layoffs will likely result in a number of claims relating to compliance with WARN Act and similar state laws, including questions of whether certain exemptions apply,\u201d Schmidt writes.\nTransitioning to a work-from-home model. Furloughing and laying off workers . Complying with new regulations from the CARES and Families First Coronavirus Response Acts. Protecting employees\u2019 personal medical information while ensuring the health and safety of the overall workforce.\nThese are just a few of the legal landmines employers are dealing with these days. The COVID-19 coronavirus and the resulting economic upheaval represent uncharted territory for many employers. As they grapple with balancing concern for employee safety while keeping business running, they\u2019ll be forced to make some unpleasant decisions. Undoubtedly, those decisions will be met with criticism and potential lawsuits.\nRecently, the family of a Walmart employee who died from COVID-19 filed a wrongful death suit against the retail giant, alleging the company ignored the man when he reported to his manager that he was feeling ill. Should the company have done more to ensure employees\u2019 safety?\n\u201cThe fact that there are only a handful of employee claims filed should not be read as indicative of a lack of future claims from employees,\u201d writes Kent Schmidt, a partner at Left Coast Law . \u201cThere is a general consensus that there will be many employee class actions.\u201d\nSchmidt expects that employment-related lawsuits will align with six broad categories, all of which employers should be aware of and consider as they plan ", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["A limited exposure to"], "gensraw_title": [[33, 3615, 7112, 285]], "probs_title": [[0.008142203092575073, 0.0011563228908926249, 0.00298802787438035, 0.7470114827156067]]}

In some states, they are continuing at health centres, but the community health workers are no longer visiting homes to immunise a child. The Union government has twice said that it has written to states to resume these activities.\nA group of public health activists wrote a letter to Rajasthan&apos;s Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on April 23. Though immunisation services were being provided at health centres, parents were not able to go there either because of lockdown or the fear of catching COVID-19 disease, they wrote.\n\"There are districts where not even a single COVID-19 case has been reported or which are out of the hotspot criteria now,\" Chhaya Pachauli, a public health activist from Rajasthan, said.\n\"These services can easily be provided at the village level in these districts by following social distancing measures and by equipping frontline health workers with the essential protective equipment,\" she added.\nThe WHO too advised countries on similar lines.\n\"Last year&apos;s deadly measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which took more than 6,000 lives in a country already facing its largest Ebola outbreak, highlights the importance of maintaining essential health services, such as immunisation in times of emergency,\" the organisation said.\n\"Further disease outbreaks will also overwhelm health systems already battling the impacts of COVID-19,\" it added.\nWHO&apos;s Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that while all efforts are on to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, if routine immunisation services are stopped, other diseases will come roaring back.\nNew WHO guidelines on immunisation and COVID-19 recommend that governments temporarily stop immunisation campaigns if there has been no any outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease.\n\"However, countries should prioritise the continuation of routine immunisation of children in essential service delivery, as well as adult vaccinations such as influenza for groups most at risk. If immunisation services must be suspended, urgent catch-up vaccinations should be rescheduled as soon as possible, prioritising those most at risk,\" it said.\nThe WHO has asked its member-states to act urgently to protect immunisation services even as the response to COVID-19 continues, in order to further minimise disease outbreaks and loss of life.\nThis includes facilitating urgent catch-up programmes in places where services have been disrupted, ensuring strong supply chains, disease surveillance and trained health workers.\nIn 2018, about 20 million children worldwide - more than 1 in 10 - missed out on life-saving vaccines such as those of measles, diphtheria and tetanus.\n\"Measles continues to remain an ever-present threat, especially if vaccination rates drop. Current projections indicate that as many as 800,000 people may have been infected with the disease in 2019,\" the WHO statement said.\n\"In 2020, there are increasing concerns about another resurgence, especially if vaccination rates fall due to delay or suspension of scheduled immunisation activities as a result of COVID-19,\" it added.\nWe are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

That is exactly what is going on in Repo land as every 2-week operation is firmly re-rolled for another 2 weeks giving those levered high powered 10x RV funds plenty of ammo to sell index cash and futures and buy the #MAGA stocks. (Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon): What is interesting is that we are starting to see the demand for repo outstrip the FEDs mandated amounts of acceptance, which gives us a little ammo to say, the FED may not be doing enough for these balance sheet starved levered risk players. As this next picture points out, the last 2-week operation was oversubscribed by $23.65 billion:\n So when investors ask us how equity markets continue to defy gravity, well we simply say because the FED is adding liquidity, discounting current dollars and thus all the smart players are rushing into real assets like tech, real value like Gold and Bitcoin and will continue to realize the FED can never raise rates and thus long US Treasury Bonds. It is really that simple and when we look at this next pic of the FED balance sheet, the log line tells us the FED is behind the curve and will continue to expand the balance sheet upwards of $5 trillion, sooner rather than later:\n HEDGEYE posted this most excellent cartoon and its a must share:\n Speaking of Bitcoin here are a few graphics to highlight yet again the power of mathematics and the technology underpinning the power of Bitcoin as well as a few charts from CME Group exhibiting the growth by which its futures contract has grown. All of this is bullish news for Bitcoin HODLers and we continue to like the space and its potential: These next two charts show the complete drubbing the Russell 2k Index Futures have had vs their Nasdaq and SP500 Index counterparts. We like valuing futures this way and it clearly shows how bad the Russell continues to get pounded:\n Finally, we are posting this chart for all our climate worrying friends. We have been listening to this disinformation narrative push for quite some time and the fact that central bankers are also getting involved means this narrative isn't going anywhere. Anyway, we understand climate better than most and we are realists when it comes to what and who actually controls our weather. Hint it\u2019s not man! Rather our realm is subject to an onslaught of cosmic rays and natural cycles by which man has zero input and zero say in. We would also like to point out that none of the climate alarmists ever talk about pollution the real bully on the block of bad human endeavors, but we know why. India and China are the leaders in that pack yet the globalists want us to believe that taxing carbon is going to solve this, going \"Green\" is going to solve this. What the hell is green anyway? You think that Tesla Lithium batteries are green? You ever extract minerals? You ever mine? You know what kind of resources that takes into account, please spare us the virtue signaling, it\u2019s appalling. Anyway, the world is done with the Hollywood, MSM garbage pitch from the high tower, they know it and we know it and its why Trump will landslide this year. Anyway, that's a topic for another time. Rather we want to focus not on the economic cycle here, but the upcoming Solar Cycle and if any of you think it comes with global warming, then by damned be fooled, but go get your Canada Goose now, for the next 50 years variability and ice are assuredly the rulers of the day and I have to thank NASA for these charts, we are quite critical of them generally, but this data, we actually can confirm from multiple unique sources, so we will give them credit where credit is due: OK, that does it, be mindful of the liquidity and if you are lazy and don't want to check, or if you don't have the time, then check us out on LinkedIn, I generally post it there and other items of note.

Blacks in the Royal Family or the Corona Virus?", "text": "Which is the Worst Threat? Blacks in the Royal Family or the Corona Virus? January 28, Screencap from the BBC show What The Fuss?\nWe don\u2019t talk much about Dave Daubenmire here. Mostly because his ideas make Paula White\u2019s ravings against marine life seem sane. Plus I am very allergic to nonsense like this.\nEarlier in the month Daubenmire outdid himself exposing something that is inherent in Quiverfull theology \u2013 racism. Most people in the QF movement hide their racism, or talk about having oodles of children to populate the world with Christians. Nancy Campbell of Above Rubies comes right to the point. Nancy will say that we need to increase our good Christian white baby output to out-breed the evil brown people. There it is, your main motivation for Quiverfull boiled down to the real reason.\nDave Daubenmire bemoaned the marriage of Meghan Markle to Prince Harry, son of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer, grandson of England\u2019s Queen Elizabeth when it happened back in 2017. Why? Racism. He claimed that Markle marrying into the British royal family was a \u2018disgrace\u2019, going on to claim it was some sort of silly Satanic plot to take down the family that was the head of, and represented all things \u201cChristian\u201d.\nNow that Harry has taken the sensible step of doing what is healthy for his growing family, stepping back from royal duties and moving the family to Canada Daubenmire had this to say:\n\u201cHow is the royal bloodline of the crown being poisoned?\u201d Daubenmire asked. \u201cIs there something special about this commoner who has married into the royalty?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s half black,\u201d Daubenmire answered. \u201cWhen [Harry and Meghan] step back, what is going to be at the heart of why she did it? What are they going to say? Come on. Wake up here. What are they going to say? \u2026 Racism! She never felt comfortable. She felt like she was below everybody else.\u201d\n\u201cThe royal family is the seat of Christianity,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe cannot deny the impact the royal family has had on the WASP-y culture; the White Anglo Saxon Protestant culture is a result of what has happened within the crown. And the crown has now, for the first time, been infiltrated with a bloodline \u2026 oh my goodness, that sounds racist, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIf this sounds racist it is because it IS racist!\nDaubenmire\u2019s claim that the royal family being the seat of Christianity is just laughable! While I admire Queen Elizabeth\u2019s for her dignity in the face of undignified circumstances all I can say is that Dave is completely devoid of historical facts. This is a family where one monarch was drunken and bisexual openly (King James I), another wedded, bedded, killed a pile of wives after a head injury (King Henry VIII), the members are notorious for their affairs (King Edward VII, rumored Prince Phillip, Prince Charles along with a long list of others) because royal mistresses were a thing too. There have been members suffering with madness tucked away, murders, and all sorts of unsavory behaviors through the years happening in the British royal family. It\u2019s naive and childish to imbue them with an almost God-like status.\nWhy is Daubenmire not focusing on real problems, genuine horrible things happening now that he could be aiding by publicizing real news beneficial for everyone, for example the emergence of the Corona Virus. I have been watching the coverage with interest because of being on an immune suppressor. Lots and lots of misinformation being spread. I am following the CDC , Johns Hopkins and a friend in Canada who works in the field of tracking health threats. Think of all the good guys like Daubenmire could do if they just dropped their silly racism, obsession with being an alpha male while being pretty substandard and other things that do not matter and focused on actually helping others. PS \u2013 I am sure some of you will be scratching your heads wondering how I jumped from the racism against Megham Markle to the Corona Virus.

There is, however, clear evidence that the novel sequence, which I will refer to henceforth as INS1378, is from a laboratory-induced recombination event.

Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a Recombined Virus .\nEvidence for: Phylogenetic clustering with Bat coronaviruses.\nEvidence against: Low bootstrap support (N=75) and presence of a INS1378.\nStatus: Falsified hypothesis.\nTest: Survey coronviruses in animals in the wild. Option 2. A recombined virus that naturally picked up a SARS-like spike protein in it N-terminus (3\u2032 end) of the viral genome.\nEvidence for: The INS1378 codon bias similar to snakes ($)\nEvidence against: Insufficient match in database search to other known CoV spike proteins (Ji et al., 2020)\nStatus: Speculative hypothesis. Unlikely.\nTest: Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will confirm). Option 3. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a bioweapon.\nBoth China and the US hinted at the other side\u2019s potential liability in playing a role in bringing about a novel coronavirus in the lab specifically for the purpose of being used as a bioweapon. To add to the intrigue, a Chinese Scientist was released from BSL-4 laboratory in Manitoba, Canada for violating protocols, allegedly sending samples of deadly viruses to mainland China.\nOn January 26, The Washington Times published this article citing an Israeli defense expert claiming that China has likely proceeded with a bioweapons program, but ending the article with a quote to London\u2019s Daily Mail from a US scientist Rutgers University microbiologist Richard Ebright that \u201cat this point there\u2019s no reason to harbor suspicions\u201d that the lab may be linked to the virus outbreak.\nThe same person was quoted in a Feb 2017 Nature article stating that SARS had escaped the Wuhan a facility in Beijing (corrected 2/2/2020) \u201cmultiple times\u201d.\nEvidence for: Presence of BSL-4 laboratory 20 miles from the Wuhan seafood market\nEvidence against: Published opinion.\nStatus: Rumor.

Here\u2019s a patent for its use in recombination virology.\nThe pShuttle-SN vector was among many described in a 1998 paper by Bert Vogelstein et al; here is a company where one can purchase the pShuttle-SN vector: {CORRECTION: THE P-SHUTTLE VECTOR PLASMID WAS DESCRIBED BY VOGELSTEIN ET AL; THE PSHUTTLE-SN VERSION IS WAS PUBLISHED IN 2005 AS CITED AT THE ADDGENE PAGE; THE RECOMBINED ADENOVIRUS PATENT LINK CITES P-SHUTTLE-SN AS WEL IN USE FOR INSERTING SARS SPIKE PROTEINS INTO OTHER ORGS }\nIt turns out that the sequence from pShuttle is most closely related to the Spike protein from SARS coronavirus.\nThis particular technology was used in 2008 to attempt to develop a more immunogenic vaccine against coronavirus. Here\u2019s a Chinese patent for that technique and product intended for use in a vaccine .\nThe patent summary reads:\nSARS vaccine of adenovirus vector and preparation method, application of coronavirus S gene Abstract(translated from Chinese) The present invention belongs to the field of genetic engineering, particularly relates to adenoviral vector SARS vaccines, their preparation and coronavirus S genes in SARS (SARS) on vaccines for the prophylaxis. By means of biological engineering, the coronavirus S gene in combination with deficient recombinant adenovirus, the protective immunogen protein or polypeptide expressed therein, through expansion culture, purification, and formulation to prepare a mucosal immunogenicity can cause the gene vaccine, respiratory mucosal immune response induced by the body to produce antibodies against the virus infection. Specific conditions of the present invention, compared with conventional inactivated virus particle vaccine, safe, easy to use, without limitation intramuscular, have broad clinical applications.\nIn 2015, The US called for an end to research creating new viruses in the lab that have increased threat (higher transmissibility, higher pathogenicity, higher lethalithy) (3)\nThe very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials;\n\u201cAn early concern for application of a SARS-CoV vaccine was the experience with other coronavirus infections which induced enhanced disease and immunopathology in animals when challenged with infectious virus [31], a concern reinforced by the report that animals given an alum adjuvanted SARS vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV exhibited an immunopathologic lung reaction reminiscent of that described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and in animal models given RSV vaccine and challenged naturally (infants) or artificially (animals) with RSV [32], [33]. We and others described a similar immunopathologic reaction in mice vaccinated with a SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [18], [20], [21], [28]. It has been proposed that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is the antigen to which the immunopathologic reaction is directed [18], [21]. Thus, concern for proceeding to humans with candidate SARS-CoV vaccines emerged from these various observations.\u201d \u2013 Tseng et al.,\nThe disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.\nEvidence for: Sequence homology between INS1378 to pShuttle Coronavirus vaccine; presence of a SARS-like Spike protein in bat coronavirus, otherwise most similar to bat coronaviruses; low bootstrap value.\nEvidence against: Low sequence homology (but highly signifiant). NB these viruses are RNA viruses and they can evolve quickly, even under laboratory conditions.\nStatus: Most likely.\nTest: Determine the nucleotide sequence all laboratory types of coronavirus being studied in China (a match will confirm). Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will falsify).\nThe available evidence most strongly supports that the 2019-NCoV virus is a vaccine strain of coronavirus either accidentally released from a laboratory accident, perhaps a laboratory researcher becoming infected with the virus while conducting animal experiments, or the Chinese were performing clinical studies of a Coronavirus vaccine in humans.\nDr. Dale Brown brought to my attention the studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals \u2013 rats, ferrets, and monkeys \u2013 in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus. \u201cCaution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated\u201d- Te et al., 2012 [ Full Text ]\nYasui et al., (2012) reported severe pneumonia in mice who were vaccinated against SARS who were subsequently infected with SARS.\nAnother study of a double-inactived SARS vaccine found increased eosinophilic proinflammatory responses in vaccinated mice, especially older mice, writing:\n\u201cImportantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication.\u201d\nIf the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\nThe implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.\nIn the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. With an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from China to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.\nRELATED: Moderately Strong Confirmation of a Laboratory Origin of 2019-nCoV", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["purpose of creating a"], "gensraw_title": [[29984, 287, 4442, 258]], "probs_title": [[0.1646294742822647, 0.9906834363937378, 0.6235800981521606, 0.9550513029098511]]}

That\u2019s as even the US admits that the Phase One trade deal will be slow off the market due to the virus impact.\nOf course, China is no stranger to Double Think: as Every put it, \"a freely-floating, controlled currency; market-determined, state-directed interest rates; and free-trade mercantilism. Yet increase economic activity from here and the virus will spread, both internally and globally. Concentrate on just the virus, and the local and global economic impact will be enormous.\"\nThat, in a nutshell, was how Rabobank saw China's \"dialectic that has no comfortable Fichtean synthesis to the thesis and antithesis\" and concluded that \"things are going to get nasty for economies and markets \u2013 especially with official WHO word that a vaccine is 18-months away.\"\nToday, two days after China officially returned to work, we got the first confirmation of just how catastrophic Beijing's order to local enterprises and businesses to rush back reboot the economy could be, when Jennifer Zeng reported that a company in Suzhou reopened, and immediately at least one CoVid2019 case found. As a result, the company's 200+ employees couldn't go home and were immediately placed under quarantine. At least the workers managed to \"organize\" quilts for themselves. Company in #Suzhou reopened. One #CoVid2019 case found. Over 200 employed couldn't go home and immediately under quarantine. They managed to organize quilts for themselves. \nThis is just the first such case. Expect many more - especially across Hubei and its neighboring provinces - as latent cases of Coronavirus which were never caught and cured spark new infections and mini epidemics, all of which dutifully captured on a smartphone clip for everyone in China to watch and freak out even more.\nWhich reminds us of another comment from Rabobank, which last week explained why the dilemma facing China is \"truly awful\":\nThe quandary for China between releasing the quarantine straitjacket in days to stop its economy from getting truly sick, and allowing a virus like this to spread further as people start to mingle again is truly awful. There are no good options. For a world with a serious lack of final end-demand, and which has been relying on China, along with increasingly \u201cChinese\u201d central banks, this is going to be a nasty shock either way that Mr Market is treating like he is Mr Magoo.\nAnd since Beijing has no way out, especially since the epidemic is still raging despite Beijing's \"doctored\", no pun intended, infection and death numbers, expect China to unleash the most draconian censorship crackdown on any reports Covid-2019 has not only not been purged but is making unwelcome appearances across China's enterprises, which will be quietly put under blanket quarantine even as Beijing pretends that all is well and its economy is once again humming on all cylinders until eventually the epidemic reaches a critical mass and China has no choice but to once again admit the full extent of the social and economic fallout. And just like in the case of SARS, don't expect such \"honesty\" to emerge for at least several weeks if not months.

Little did we know when we embarked on our vacation that we would sail into \u201c Groundhog Day \u201d-like surrealism off the coast of Yokohama, Japan.\nOur journey started out innocuously. My husband Phil and I spent five days in Japan with friends from Crystal River, Fla., before setting out on the Diamond Princess. For two weeks, we enjoyed dances, shows and other cruise activities. We had a lavish dinner on Feb. 3 \u2014 escargot, prime rib and creme brulee \u2014 and that night put our luggage in the hallway so crew members could offload our bags more easily the next morning.\nAD We then heard that a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong had tested positive for the new virus edging its way out of China. The captain announced that there might be delays with disembarking and that passengers needed to be tested. The ship entered the port of Yokohama, and a phalanx of quarantine officers boarded. Our temperatures would be checked, we were told, because elevated temperatures are an early sign of infection.\nAD We slept fitfully. The next morning, the captain, in his mellifluous Italian accent, announced that passengers could have breakfast as usual and then return to their cabins. Examining a ship full of people would take time; they estimated it would be at least 24 additional hours. We could roam the ship, we were told. We did, but opted to avoid the crowded buffet.\nI grabbed some fruit and desserts for our stateroom, not knowing how else to stock up on food. That night, there were no instructions to put out our luggage. The next morning, the captain announced that a 14-day quarantine had been imposed and said we were not allowed to leave our rooms. Six hours later, a steward brought a meager breakfast of two yogurt cups, two bottles of water and two scoops of fruit salad.\nAD The luxury cruise was over. We were prisoners in a posh penitentiary.\nAD The days since have slipped into one another. The captain\u2019s voice has become wearier as he relays the grim statistics: 10 new cases of infection, another 10, 41. A total of 64, then 135, then 218 . With each new infection, I become more anxious. Our ship gets daily bulletins from the U.S. Consulate in Tokyo, but no one offers what we most need: a jailbreak.\nI am 75, and my husband is 77. With my insulin supply dwindling, I tried to order more through the ship but got nowhere for a week. Luckily, our phones and Internet work, and a doctor friend in Florida shipped a refill to our floating penitentiary. After delays in customs, my medication reached me on Friday.\nAD So far, my lowest point has not been my medication anxiety but, instead, seeing a bus pull up and fire trucks line up to block media coverage of a partial evacuation. Reports have suggested that men in their 70s are at high risk for infection. There is no telling who is next to be released \u2014 or next to fall ill.\nAD After our temperatures were taken on the first day of quarantine, no one checked us for a week. On the fifth day, we were given electronic thermometers and told to report any readings above 99.5. Phil quivers through the interminable wait for the reading that lets him know he\u2019s safe \u2014 for now. We have no idea whether people will accurately self-report or possibly try to ride out a fever. We were finally swabbed on Friday and told that results would take three days.\nThe timing of our test was dictated by our ages. We don\u2019t know why everyone on board, especially the crew, was not tested immediately. Even if testing supplies are expensive, or limited, or both, what other situation are kits reasonably being saved for?\nAD The Japanese government must protect its citizens while also treating all on board this ship ethically. News reports Friday indicated more than 40 new cases just among the 3,500-plus people \u2014 passengers and crew \u2014 on board the Diamond Princess. Surely quarantining healthy people with sick ones is not the best option for anyone on this ship or on land. Japan has to find a reasonable balance for citizens and visitors alike. If healthy tourists risk exposure through forced quarantines, what might that mean for, say, the Tokyo Olympics this summer? Who will risk sitting in a crowded stadium in Japan, or sending their athletes to compete?\nAD Peering out at the lights of Yokohama, I imagine that some of the twinkling comes from the U.S. military base, with its dock and hospital. Isn\u2019t that considered U.S. soil? A few people have been allowed to leave this ship. Those still stuck here are desperate for everyone on board to be tested so that those who are healthy today will not be infected tomorrow.\nRead mor e:\nDana Milbank: As health experts sound the alarm, Trump fights coronavirus with alternative facts\nRichard Haass: Why the coronavirus should change the way we think about China\nDavid Ignatius: How the coronavirus threatens Xi\u2019s \u2018Chinese dream\u2019\nRobert Gebelhoff: An epidemic expert: Are we past the point of containment for coronavirus?\nWhat you need to know about coronavirus Updated February 15, 2020 The latest : The first coronavirus death outside of Asia was reported in France.\nAmericans aboard the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner off the coast of Japan were notified by they U.S. government that they would be evacuated, but will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine once back in the United States.\nHere are the biggest questions surrounding coronavirus .\nAre you in isolation or quarantine because of the coronavirus?

Our message to Nigerians is to report immediately to the nearest health facility if you notice any of these symptoms.\n\u201cHealth care workers should adhere to standard precautions at all times to ensure they protect themselves and that preparedness measures for the novel coronavirus is a collective responsibility.\u201d\nAccording to the NCDC, the case fatality rate from the novel Coronavirus outbreak in parts of the world is very low.\n\u201cThere has been no case of CoronaVirus recorded in Nigeria. No travel restriction has been placed by WHO. Our advice to Nigerians is to limit contact with animals if you must visit China and ensure good personal hygiene at all times.\u201d\nOn Thursday in response to the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the NCDC issued a public health advisory placing the Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria on alert and heightened screening measures at points of entry Into the country.\nIn the advisory, travelers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets.\nREAD ALSO: WHO committee says coronavirus, not a global emergency \u201cTravelers from Wuhan to Nigeria, may be asked questions upon arrival by the Port Health Services unit at points of entry about symptoms of illness and travel history, and are advised to report immediately to NCDC, if they feel ill after a trip to Wuhan.\u201d\nThe advisory said the Federal Ministry of Health through NCDC and its partners are fully committed to strengthening preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks and that information will be shared with the public as it becomes available.\nMeanwhile, WHO\u2019s Regional Office for Europe has officially been notified of the first novel coronavirus cases in Europe.\nThree cases have been confirmed in France and WHO is in contact with the relevant authorities. WHO encourages countries in the European Region to continue to prepare.\nThe NCDC noted that as this is a new virus, and new information is emerging every day, this advisory will be updated as new information and research on the virus and its impact on populations become available.\nIt noted that the first case of the novel coronavirus strain (2019nCoV) was confirmed in China on the 7th of January, 2020.\n\u201cCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are normally transmitted between animals and people. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of the virus that has not been previously identified in humans.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) convened its Emergency Committee on Thursday and said it was too early to declare the outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Event of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC).\nSymptoms\nThis new coronavirus, 2019nCoV, appears to cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms like cough and breathing difficulties. From current evidence, it appears that death is a rare outcome, and occurs mostly in patients with underlying illness.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for disease caused by the novel coronavirus yet. However, many of the symptoms can be treated. Therefore, treatment is based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition. In addition, supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.\nNigeria\u2019s preparedness and response\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is currently coordinating a multisectoral technical group that is assessing and managing the risk of importation to Nigeria. NCDC is in close communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) who is closely monitoring the situation globally. WHO is in direct communication with the Government of China and other affected countries, and has released technical and travel guidance.\nThe Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria has been placed on alert and has heightened screening measures at the points of entry. In China, exit screening measures have been enhanced for travellers from Wuhan city at the Points of Entry (PoE) (airports and ground transport stations) since the 14th of January, 2020. This includes temperature checks combined with provision of information and masks to passengers with fever, as well as directing symptomatic passengers to health facilities for follow up.\nNigerians are advised to remain calm. Travelers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets.\nTravelers from Wuhan to Nigeria, may be asked questions upon arrival by the Port Health Services unit at points of entry about symptoms of illness and travel history, and are advised to report immediately to NCDC if they feel ill after a trip to Wuhan.\nHow to protect yourself\nTo reduce the risk of spread of coronavirus, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following measures:\nWash your hands regularly with soap under running water. Cover your mouth and nose properly with handkerchief or tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing. You may also cough into your elbow if a handkerchief is not available. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid self-medication, report to the nearest health facility when you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms. Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history.

Due to the sexual life cycle of the parasite, transmission is complex. There are no restrictions on sexual recombination between ... [Show full abstract] sub-populations, meaning that large-scale genetic recombination may occur within a host, potentially confounding epidemiological analysis. To clarify the relationships between infections in different hosts, it is first necessary to correctly identify species and genotypes, but these differentiations are not made by standard diagnostic tests and more sophisticated molecular methods have been developed. For instance, multilocus genotyping has been utilized to differentiate isolates within the major human pathogens, Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis. This has allowed mixed populations with multiple alleles to be identified: recombination events are considered to be the driving force of increased variation and the emergence of new subtypes. As yet, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is having limited impact on public health investigations, due in part to insufficient numbers of oocysts and purity of DNA derived from clinical samples. Moreover, because public health agencies have not prioritized parasites, validation has not been performed on user-friendly data analysis pipelines suitable for public health practitioners. Nonetheless, since the first whole genome assembly in 2004 there are now numerous genomes of human and animal-derived cryptosporidia publically available, spanning nine species. It has also been demonstrated that WGS from very low numbers of oocysts is possible, through the use of amplification procedures. These data and approaches are providing new insights into host-adapted infectivity, the presence and frequency of multiple sub-populations of Cryptosporidium spp. within single clinical samples, and transmission of infection. Analyses show that although whole genome sequences do indeed contain many alleles, they are invariably dominated by a single highly abundant allele. These insights are helping to better understand population structures within hosts, which will be important to develop novel prevention strategies in the fight against cryptosporidiosis.

In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.\nSimilar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.\nUpon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.\nClover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.\n\u201cI am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.\u201d said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. \u201cWe remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses\u201d.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,\u201d said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. \u201cTo this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.\u201d\nAbout Clover Biopharmaceuticals\nClover Biopharmaceuticals is a global, clinical-stage, research-based biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative biologic therapies, with a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases, as well as viral vaccines. Having raised more than US$ 100 million in total capital since 2016, Clover is utilizing its proprietary Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology platform to develop novel biologics targeting trimerization-dependent pathways.

This will probably not be the last deadly disease to successfully attack human, animal and plant genetic groups that are not physically separated.

It is even possible that some countries would genetically engineer specific diseases because of their belief systems. We should try to keep our farms genetically diversified to avoid a sweeping disease that would spread easily through a mono-culture such as corn.

Cryptosporidium and Giardia in Ruminants Cryptosporidium and Giardia are ubiquitous protozoan parasites that infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including domestic and wild animals as well as humans. Both parasites are of medical and veterinary importance. Infections with Cryptosporidium and Giardia in ruminants are associated with diarrhea outbreaks, mainly in young animals. Ruminants are potential sources of infection for humans because some species of Cryptosporidium and assemblages of Giardia duodenalis have been isolated from both ruminants and humans. Knowledge of these parasites has greatly expanded in the last 2 decades from simple microscopic obser...

Of course the mainstream media is not exactly helping matters when they use phrases such as \u201cdeath sentence\u201d to describe this pandemic.\n\nYes, we should all be taking this virus very seriously, but the truth is that this is not the end of the world and everyone needs to calm down.\n\nDo we really want to have a society where everyone is spying on their neighbors?  When I read that a mother in Wisconsin had been visited by the police because she had permitted her daughter to go play at a friend\u2019s house, it really touched a nerve with me\u2026  A Wisconsin mom videotaped two police officers who showed up at her home and accused her of \u201callowing\u201d her daughter to play at a friend\u2019s house, an act they deemed to be in defiance of Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cStay at Home\u201d order.\n\nThe officers are clearly agitated and condescending in their conversation with the mother, who is addressed as \u201cAmy\u201d when she opens the door upon their arrival.\n\nSo how did the police know that her daughter had gone to another house to play?\n\nNeedless to say, someone snitched on her.\n\nAnd this next story is truly bizarre.  A Colorado woman named Heather Silchia was deeply alarmed when she discovered that her \u201cneighbors\u201d had put a really nasty note on her vehicle\u2026\n\nThe missive read, \u201cPLEASE STAY HOME. I noticed a few days a week you leave home with your baby and return a short time later without it. Then I see the man of the house arrive with the baby later in the afternoon while your vehicle hasn\u2019t moved all day. This leads me to believe that the kid is in daycare.\u201d\n\nThe letter continued, \u201cStop. I am assuming that man has an essential job since he is gone all day but if you are home there is no reason for your child to be in daycare at a time like this. I also see you leave shortly after your husband (I assume) gets home. You aren\u2019t wearing any sort of uniform and I have never seen you wear a mask. Bars are closed and you couldn\u2019t possibly be getting groceries every night (which would also require you to wear a mask) so I again ask you to please stay home.\u201d\n\nWell, it turns out that Heather Silchia is actually a 911 dispatcher, and that is why she can\u2019t watch her baby all day.\n\nAnd we should be thankful for front line workers like her, because they are so greatly needed during a time like this.\n\nSadly, the examples that I have just shared with you are not isolated incidents.  In fact, it has been revealed that there are hundreds of people that have been snitching on their neighbors in the state of Missouri alone\u2026\n\nHundreds of people have been exposed for reporting people who have flouted social distancing rules and some are now scared they could receive a backlash. The names and addresses of approximately 900 people in Missouri were released as part of a media request under the Sunshine Law, which allows for the release of information submitted to a public agency (except for wrongdoing and abuse tips).\n\nSt. Louis County had urged the community to share details of anyone not following guidelines in response to the coronavirus pandemic and noted in the terms and conditions that information may be shared publicly. However some people may not have read the small print submitted tips via an online form and email from the end of March. Many had asked for their communications to remain private.\n\nIf things are this bad in Missouri, one can only imagine the level of snitching that is happening in New York or California.\n\nAnd even though some states are starting to gradually lift their \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, the truth is that our society is going to be dealing with \u201csocial distancing\u201d for a long time to come.  In fact, the way that we share many of our public spaces is in danger of being permanently redefined\u2026\n\nNew designs for eating places. McDonald\u2019s is already prototyping a socially distanced version of its restaurant that could be a template for fast-food spaces around the world.\n\nCheckerboard grids on the grass in parks, with people allowed to occupy one square only if those surrounding it are empty.\n\nOr time-sharing of public places: If you don\u2019t show up for your 12:15 p.m. slot at the playground, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nOf course snitches will have a field day in this sort of an environment.  If you sit too close to a snitch in church or you walk too closely behind a snitch on the sidewalk, you may find yourself explaining your actions to the police.\n\nAnd what is truly tragic is that none of this nonsense is even necessary.  Please take two and a half minutes and watch this video from Dr. Eric Berg.  It is the most important video about this pandemic that I have watched by a wide margin. After watching the video, I think that you will understand why all of the coronavirus lockdowns should be ended as soon as possible.\n\nYes, this virus spreads incredibly easily.  But a lot of the people that catch it never show any symptoms at all, and it has become clear that there are things that we can do for those that do become sick to prevent a lot of the really severe cases.\n\nUnfortunately, the mainstream media is not going to tell you the truth.  Instead, they are just going to keep telling you that the death toll projections are going up and that everyone should continue to stay home.\n\nLook, the reality of the matter is that most of the population is eventually going to be exposed to this virus no matter if we have lockdowns or not.  So it is very important to be taking your vitamins and to be doing whatever you can to support your immune system.  And it is also very important to understand that this is not even close to the worst thing that we are going to face.\n\nIf we can\u2019t even handle COVID-19, and if the mainstream media won\u2019t even share the truth when scientific studies show absolutely amazing results, what is going to happen to our society when a really severe crisis comes along?", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Consultants could"], "gensraw_title": [[9445, 587, 1188, 715]], "probs_title": [[0.00056480459170416, 0.055445849895477295, 0.2347303032875061, 0.001042991760186851]]}

It is so disgusting to see those ass clowns now try to go nearly 24/7 round the clock \"reporting\" on this supposed and alleged \"epidemic\" in China, while at the same time trying to scare the living hell out of viewers with false claims that this \"epidemic\" will soon be here in North America I have already shown in the previous article about this hysteria and fraud how these criminals have been trying to sell the gullible public the lies that there are \"people falling over and dying in the streets\" from this Corona Virus, and I have another key point to bring forward in this article as well...\nI want to present the following most interesting report, that comes from Marko Marjanovic, through the Aletho News website, at www.alethonews.com, that shows that the median age of those who have supposedly died from this \"killer\" virus is 75 YEARS of age! Here in fact is that report, and I have further thoughts and comments to follow:\nThe Median Age of Wuhan Virus Fatalities Is 75 By Marko Marjanovi\u0107 | Anti-Empire | January 24, 2020 When a new disease appears a measure of concern is natural since we don\u2019t know yet what we\u2019re dealing with, but just statistically it\u2019s highly unlikely a disease, just because it is new, will be particularly deadly. On the contrary, chances are a new disease will be no more deadly or untreatable than the average existing one. We can applaud China for taking the threat seriously, just to be on the safe side, but there is no reason to fall for the media\u2019s relentless attempts to maximize your stress levels. They\u2019ll use every trick in the book to maximize your attention and earn a bigger advertiser buck. We go through this every couple of years. Mad cow disease, bird flu, SARS, ebola are just a few of the past examples. In the end, none of them ever racked up high body counts. The Wuhan virus has so far killed 26 people, all of whom were elderly or had pre-existing conditions. In fact, the median age of the first 19 victims is 75-years old. This new disease so far looks like a type of flu, quite possibly a weaker and more survivable strain. The common flu kills 300,000-600,000 people yearly, depending on the year. Likewise overwhelmingly among the elderly.\nNTS Notes: Yes, the facts are that this Corona Virus has indeed caused some deaths in Wuhan, China.. But what is NOT being told is that the vast majority of the victims of this \"deadly disease\" have already been suffering from ailments that weaken their immune system!\nAnd the facts are that the majority of those who have fallen victim to this \"epidemic\" are the elderly, and according to the list most probably again have failing immune systems and are already suffering from other diseases and respiratory illnesses It therefore shows that those who are much younger and stronger may also contract this disease, but due to their stronger immune systems are more readily able to fight off the disease....\nReaders, what we have here is further proof that all of this fear mongering from those who are trying to sell the notion that this is an \"epidemic\" in the making is nothing but bull crap, and the proponents of that stupidity are full of shit\nI will say that it is sad that there are indeed victims of this virus.... But for the Jew spew media to try to sell the notion that this is an \"epidemic in the making\" and that everyone could be infected and possibly die is not only hysteria, but absolutely abominable! But again, they have their marching orders, and the agenda behind this propaganda is obvious in trying to get everyone to line up and get their \"vaccine\" for this \"disease\" the moment it becomes available....

Another 25 were work permit holders living outside the dormitories, said the Health Ministry on Sunday. There were also two imported cases reported today. Both are Singaporeans who have been placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore on Apr 10, said the ministry. Only 13 cases were from the local community, Singapore citizens and permanent residents (foreigners), with another five on work passes (foreigners), said the Ministry. The Sunday's cases raised the total number to 13,624. Twenty-two of the 1,311 cases still in hospital are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Most are stable or their condition is improving, the ministry said. Fifty-eight people were discharged following recovery. In all, 1,060 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. Meanwhile, 11,241 cases are currently isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are cases that have mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19, Channel News Asia reported citing the ministry data. Singapore is now in an extended \"circuit breaker\" period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The period was extended to June 1, 2020 from the first set to end on May 4. It will take at least a week of sustained decline in local community cases, which excludes migrant workers, before Singapore can say that it has turned the corner, reported The Straits Times citing experts. The latest numbers on Sunday reined in any optimism that Singapore may be beginning to see some early signs of the infection curve flattening. On Saturday, nine community cases were confirmed, marking the first time numbers have dropped to the single digits this month. Numbers at dormitories also dropped to 597, down from about an average of a thousand daily in the five days before. Experts told The Straits Times that the slide in community cases needs to be sustained until at least the first week of May, and even then, the clusters at dormitories may remain a challenge. Foreign workers' dormitories have been locked down as the government struggles to curb the second wave of the COVID-19. Earlier, reported Channel News Asia cited experts as saying that five weeks from now if the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the community falls to single digits and the situation in the foreign worker dormitories improves, \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d measures in Singapore may ease gradually. \n", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["First 10 days in 2018 COVID-19 positive cases 'clearly points to downward trend'"], "gensraw_title": [[5963, 839, 1529, 288, 2865, 7376, 11009, 13, 1130, 3968, 2664, 706, 20064, 307, 2174, 285, 20842, 5183, 7, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.0017463957192376256, 0.00894906371831894, 0.5396103262901306, 0.027358729392290115, 0.002306692535057664, 0.03151782229542732, 0.9892521500587463, 0.9195154309272766, 0.9615567922592163, 0.00046126023516990244, 0.7610054612159729, 0.0012847366742789745, 0.0012776958756148815, 0.9062672257423401, 0.00042647472582757473, 0.712573230266571, 0.05591864883899689, 0.7775432467460632, 0.8323907256126404, 0.8469005823135376]]}

It is a family of viruses that includes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), so called because of the spikes on the surface of the virus, which seems to form a corona or crown. The current novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China is a new strain.\n2| Is coronavirus deadly? The currently spreading novel coronavirus is highly infectious and has killed 170 people as of this writing. Yes, it is deadly.\n3| Where does coronavirus come from?\nNot from Corona or beer. Scientists think the novel coronavirus is a strain that jumped from snakes to humans, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology . The virus has since mutated to be able to pass from human to human through coughing and sneezing.\n4| Where does Corona Beer come from? Corona is produced in Mexico and is the top-selling imported beer in the United States.

A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.\nThere is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.\nThe symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu\u2014fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.\nCorona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.\nSo, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection\u2014corona virus included. I would check that off the list.\nFirst, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A and C. Most people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack. If you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/day every hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period. For vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)\nIodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine. As I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can\u2019t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years. The RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues.

(Photo provided by Sherry Gay-Dagnogo via AP) AP Jamon Jordan poses with a photo of his mother, Jacquelynne Jordan, in Detroit, Friday, April 24, 2020. Jamon Jordan could not mourn his mother in the traditional way. At Jacquelynne Jordan\u2019s memorial in early April, there were just seven people. No hugs. No traditional dinner where family members could gather to honor the 66-year-old matriarch\u2019s memory after she died from the new coronavirus COVID-19.  Jamon Jordan could not mourn his mother in the traditional way. At Jacquelynne Jordan's memorial in early April, there were just seven people. No hugs. No traditional dinner where family members could gather to honor the 66-year-old matriarch's memory.\nThat stripped-down scenario has played out hundreds of times in Detroit \u2014 912 to be exact, the number of city residents who have died of COVID-19.\nSo amid the pandemic, Detroit \u2014 the nation's largest black city, the birthplace of distinctive soulful music and black cultural significance \u2014 grieves collectively.\nFamed across the world as Motown, Detroiters know it as a big city with a small-town feel, with a connectivity that has only magnified the community's pain.\n\"People always say that Detroit is like a northern country town,\" said Marsha Battle Philpot, a cultural writer known as Marsha Music. \"There tends to be very closely knit familial connections. In Detroit, there's not six degrees of separation \u2014 there are only two and, most of the time, just one. Detroit has this character, which in a time like this, exacerbates the grief and the loss. But it will also be part of the recovery because Detroit is a fighting town.\"\nThe virus has disproportionately impacted black Americans across the country, including Detroit, where more than 8,500 infections have been reported, with black people accounting for more than 64% of them. And nearly 77% of the city's residents who have died from coronavirus-related complications have been African American. The losses have shattered the city, compounded by a heightened economic uncertainty.\nAmong those lost: community pillars, dedicated public servants and Michigan's youngest victim, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert, whose parents, LaVondria and Ebbie Herbert, have served Detroit for decades \u2014 as a police officer and a firefighter.\n\"They've been on the front line and they've served with honor and integrity,\" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said after Skylar's death. \"They did not deserve to lose their child to this virus. Nobody does.\"'\nJamon Jordan, who runs the Black Scroll Network History and Tours company in Detroit, contracted COVID-19 himself, most likely while giving tours in early March.\nWhile he was battling the virus, his mother also fell ill. Despite his mother having existing health conditions, he said they both struggled to convince doctors they needed to be tested and were told not to come to the hospital and instead self-quarantine for two weeks.\nJordan got better; his mother grew sicker. She died March 28.\n\"She did not make it to two weeks,\" Jordan said. \"She was brought in by ambulance and, within an hour of arriving to the hospital, she had already passed away. I made it, but she didn't.\"\nAnd then her family could safely offer only an abbreviated farewell.\n\"In the African American community, homegoing celebrations, funerals, are just a part of a very spiritual experience that allows family and the community to move this ancestor onto the afterlife,\" said Jordan, a black historian. \"It's a part of a communal practice that goes all the way back to our African roots.\n\"It's a blow to this culture, our practices, our traditions, that we can't really say goodbye,\" he said. \"When this is over, there are things that will not exist in our community, there are ideas that we will never see come to fruition. Detroit will be different.\"\nTributes cascade in every day on a Facebook COVID-19 group memorial page created by Michigan State Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo. Just weeks after she started it, Gay-Dagnogo's own sister became one of hundreds honored on the page.\nJulena Gay was Gay-Dagnogo's backbone, everything a sister should be. She died April 14 at the age of 63.\n\"This type of collective loss, it's profound,\" Gay-Dagnogo said. \"There's a fear of 'am I next?' I started this page because people need to get beyond the thought that black people aren't dying \u2014 they're dying in record numbers.\"\nBeyond the grief lies deep economic pain.\nDespite gains in recent years, including the city emerging from bankruptcy, swaths of neighborhoods remain blighted and 33% of Detroit residents live below the poverty line. And city leaders announced this month that the pandemic has created a projected $348 million budget deficit.\nA poll shared exclusively with The Associated Press, conducted in early April by the University of Michigan's Detroit Metro Area Communities Study, found 35% of Detroiters employed full time or part time before March 1 have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. The study surveyed 1,020 residents across demographics.\nJeffrey Morenoff, one of the study's faculty research leads and director of the university's Population Studies Center, said roughly 1 in 5 Detroiters say they will run out of money in three months. And research associate Lydia Wileden said the survey also found 49% of black residents are concerned about access to food, water and other supplies and 42% said they wouldn't be able to afford a $400 emergency expense.\nFor now, the focus is on how to help the city survive the widening ripples of devastating loss.\n\"There's going to be an aftermath of this, not only physically, socially, spiritually but also, mentally,\" said Bishop Edgar Vann, who has been senior pastor of Detroit's Second Ebenezer Church for 45 years.\n\"It's going to be difficult whenever you reopen because the norms that we had will be old and shattered. But there is a uniqueness about the city and, of course, one of them is the population being 80% African American. There is a certain spirit here, there's a grit, toughness and resilience.\"\n___\nKat Stafford is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

This apparently follows the insight that the initial cover-up by the Chinese authorities played an inglorious role in the Sars 2002/03 lung disease crisis: as a result, the number of victims increased and 800 people were killed, and the population\u2019s confidence was lost , Sars had then broken out in the hinterland of Hong Kong in the Guangdong province. Because the authorities initially covered up the problem, autonomous Hong Kong became a hotspot for the dangerous infectious disease. China\u2019s regime is still struggling with the loss of confidence there, as the ongoing protests show. The scandals of contaminated milk powder in 2008 and a rapid train accident in 2011, which were also hushed up, sowed further distrust. In times of social media, this can quickly turn into a political crisis for any regime. China\u2019s powerful head of state and party leader Xi Jinping, under whose rule there was a strong centralization of power, appears to be aware of the political danger and has positioned itself clearly at the beginning of the week with the call for \u201ccomprehensive measures to prevent and control\u201d the virus. He has made combating the corona virus his own affair and linked it to his image at home and abroad. So far, observers have certified that the regime has responded appropriately to the crisis, has included well-respected experts at an early stage and has given information in a fairly open manner. It is of course much too early for a final assessment. But already now the question arises how transparent a regime can be at all, which otherwise knows no transparency for reasons of political power and is much more based on the principles of control, whitewashing as well as command and obedience. A Hong Kong communications scientist has determined that China\u2019s regime continues to act according to its usual mechanisms: the information, the media, and the narrative are controlled, giving the impression that the government is in control of the situation. The fact that the call quoted at the beginning was deleted after only a few hours shows that the regime is still struggling to the right degree and that the transparency demanded by some continues to have narrow limits.\n,", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["China\u2019s Coronageddon\u2026 And Its Response"], "gensraw_title": [[14582, 448, 248, 83, 2745, 262, 33055, 1400, 844, 6364, 18262, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.2613951861858368, 0.46724840998649597, 0.9992049336433411, 0.9995786547660828, 0.4998571574687958, 0.18375058472156525, 0.005670799873769283, 0.0004635067598428577, 0.0718589797616005, 0.042706456035375595, 0.03382398188114166, 0.692815899848938]]}

But the whole while, I ate crappy food, rarely exercised, guzzled diet soda and rarely slept. I abused my body through stress and overwork.\nToday, I am an African American man in my early 50s who battles high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and hypertension.

I am not alone. This virus is wiping out black people like me in hugely disproportionate numbers . Read More Color of Covid: The racial justice paradox of our new stay-at-home economy If the African American community is going to beat this virus -- and create a pandemic-resistant black community -- we are going to have to make big changes in both our public systems and our personal lives. This virus is especially lethal to African Americans because it is -- in effect -- a pandemic jumping on top of multiple, pre-existing epidemics that were already ravaging the black community. Diseases like hypertension, diabetes, asthma and obesity make the virus far more deadly. And African American communities have those illnesses in numbers that are way out of proportion. Why are African Americans so vulnerable? Why is that? The reasons for poor health outcomes in the black community are complex. It's not just workaholic crusaders like me whose health is sub-optimal. African Americans tend to work in physically challenging jobs -- ones that demand much, pay less and offer worse health insurance. That's a recipe for bad health right there. Also, doctors have been shown to give us shoddier services, even when we have health insurance. Additionally, we tend to live in neighborhoods where the stores sell less healthy food; fast food joints and liquor stores provide too many meals in urban America. JUST WATCHED Magic Johnson calls out racial disparities with pandemic Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nMagic Johnson calls out racial disparities with pandemic 02:56 There are other factors as well. Many traditional \"black foods\" boast much more cholesterol and sugar than the US Food and Drug Administration recommends. And to some African Americans, healthier choices -- like adopting a plant-based diet, exploring meditation, practicing yoga, etc. -- may seem culturally alien. While navigating the perilous waters of racial bias, and simultaneously attending to often distressed families and communities, it can be hard to prioritize self-care. All of these factors together make African Americans more likely to have diseases that make Covid-19 deadly. We need complex solutions -- not false choices. How can we fix the situation? Two familiar lines of thinking have emerged: The government needs to take more responsibility for ending the structural, systemic racism on full display right now in our health care and economic systems. Black people need to take more responsibility for our individual health choices. All too often, these two options are presented as opposing solutions -- or even warring points of view. And anyone who stresses #2 might be accused of blaming the victim and ignoring systemic racism. Celebrities unite to show support for underserved communities battling coronavirus But this is a falsely framed debate. We are not faced with an either/or choice. One can insist upon structural reforms, while also embracing positive personal lifestyle changes. I certainly intend to do both, going forward. After all, any meaningful improvement in black wellness will require major change -- from both institutions AND individuals. There's no question: The system must change. For an activist like myself, the need to change the system is obvious. Ensuring the health of African Americans means addressing the lack of access (food deserts), racial discrimination in healthcare and the epidemic of over-incarceration. It means confronting the legacy of structural inequalities that were devastating black communities long before anyone had ever heard of the coronavirus. African Americans and our allies should intensify the fight for these reforms. And we need to change, too. That said: we must also take more responsibility for our own health. And boosting our immune health must be job number one. The science makes clear that our lifestyle choices -- around sleep, nutrition, stress, and more -- directly affect our ability to strengthen our immune system. And at a time when the virus is doing disproportionate damage to our communities, we need to ask: what can we do as individuals to get ourselves and our loved ones out of harm's way? For example, we can all vow to eat healthier. Drink more water. Move our bodies. Process emotional pain through therapy, rather than comfort eating or substance abuse. Commit to a spiritual or religious practice. Meditate. Rest. Get more sleep. And let's not forget to practice gratitude. In the midst of this plague, every unlabored, unaided breath is more precious than ever. Black influencers set the agenda for global culture. We can make the quest for personal health as cool as we have made the quest for personal wealth. Imagine if rap videos and black TV shows started showcasing push-ups, Peloton and healthy green drinks, in the same way that they often showcase fashion and foreign cars. Black health & wellness already gaining traction. Here's the good news: there is already a vibrant health and wellness movement in the black community. (Did you know African Americans are the fastest growing demographic of veganism ?)

I commit to improving the system -- and my own health, too. The necessary structural reforms will take time to enact. But the lifestyle choices we make -- about what we eat and drink, how we live, how we treat our bodies and manage our stress -- can go into effect immediately. Big, racially-biased systems do limit our options. And yet even within those limitations, we have choices to make. I can't control the words that come out of any politician's mouth.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200423005604/en/\nAs widely reported, widespread testing of millions of people is currently hampered by a shortage of testing supplies. Each Origin One 3D printer has the ability to produce batches of 1,500 Origin NP O1 Swabs at a time, multiple times daily. Origin is moving towards a streamlined process allowing the production of approximately 190,000 per day, or 1.3 million per week.\nStratasys will leverage its position as a leading provider of 3D printing solutions to the healthcare industry to market Origin NP O1 Swabs. Stratasys has already been actively serving healthcare systems across the country during the pandemic by leading a coalition that has been providing 3D-printed face shields to nearly 100 front-line organizations. To date, the coalition has provided about 40,000 shields at no cost to health systems.\nStratasys Americas President Rich Garrity said Stratasys is ready to help get millions of swabs to wherever they are most needed. \"We have tremendous confidence in Origin's 3D printing technology, and we're confident in our ability to help bring them to market efficiently,\" he said.\nOrigin CEO, Christopher Prucha said Origin is ready to scale quickly. \"We believe widespread testing can help save lives and get our economy going again, and we're confident that our Origin One technology and simple material requirements will be able to produce millions of swabs to meet the need,\" he said. \"We've been impressed by the speed with which Stratasys has been able to provide thousands of shields to healthcare systems across the country and believe they are the right partner for helping get millions of swabs where they are most needed.\"\nOrigin swabs were tested in a clinical trial with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an academic medical center affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Origin reports that results show Origin swabs performed the highest with regard to concordance to control swabs compared to two other 3D printed swabs. In addition, in subjective feedback, Origin swabs were preferred over the other 3D printed swabs.\nEach Origin NP O1 Swab is autoclavable and individually packaged.

Someone had alerted me that former NBA Los Angeles Lakers player, Kobe Bryant, and his daughter, had just died in a tragic helicopter crash in California, and we all discussed that for a while... But the subject quickly turned to the \"Corona Virus\" and many sitting at the table had the look of shock and fear... They talked openly about what we were all going to do if the \"virus\" came and started killing people locally here in central Canada, and apparently many were indeed brainwashed by the lies coming from the Jew spew media, which especially troubled me.... I tried my best to calm many of their fears and explained some truths about the \"virus\" and that there was no need to panic.... After I left the group, I knew that I needed to continue to show some real truths here at this blog about this \"virus\" just to have people realize that the fear mongering out there is just to have people panic and cry out for their crooked governments to do something to \"ease\" their fears!\nWell, I came across the following report, from the Waking Times website, at www.wakingtimes.com, that is entitled: \"8 Things To Consider Before Panicking About The Coronavirus\" and indeed gives some valid points to show that people should think about before they allow themselves to fall victim to the hysteria and panic about this \"virus\" Here in fact is that article for everyone to see right here, and I have my own thoughts and comments to follow:\n8 THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE PANICKING ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS January 25, 2020\nPhillip Schneider , Staff Writer Waking Times If you read the news, you\u2019ve likely heard about the \u201cdeadly\u201d coronavirus in China. You\u2019ve probably seen videos of sick people and heard about the impending doom that our great nation faces if we don\u2019t do something about this grave threat coming from China. But have you ever thought about why we\u2019re hearing so much about this virus, despite it affecting only a relatively small number of people in another country? Who benefits from a mass media hype around the Coronavirus?\n1. This Story is Getting Massive Hype No one can deny the incredible hype that this story is getting. But, why? Nearly every major news outlet is front-paging the news about the virus. NBC warns of the rising death toll, CNN frightens us with \u201cdiving\u201d stocks due to coronavirus fears (the DOW dropped by 0.6% while other stocks like Bowing grew by 1.7%), the Drudge Report sounds the alarm on the spreading outbreak triggering the quarantine of 56 million people, but China\u2019s state run communist newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, reports only 41 total deaths from coronavirus and 34 cured and released, with the total number of confirmed cases to date at 1287 . Yet, every new development is serious front page news. CNBC released an updating map of those affected by the virus. In China, it looks like they are absolutely swamped with illness, however, to say that the true number of cases is minuscule compared with China\u2019s population of 1.4 billion would be the world\u2019s greatest understatement of the century. Is the media simply reporting justifiably on a virus that could potentially affect millions of people, or do they have ulterior motives? 2. Nobody Knows Where the Virus Came From So, where did the virus come from anyway? Some speculate it originated in snakes , or previously from bats or contact with other animals in an open-air food market in Wuham, but if that\u2019s true, is there no connection to the fact that the Chinese government opened up a new biolab in the same city, allegedly tasked with studying the \u201cworld\u2019s most dangerous pathogens\u201d? Even the science journal Nature was concerned with the facility prior to its operation in 2017 . So, did the Chinese government accidentally or intentionally release the virus? Did it end up in bats, then snakes, then humans? Why were they working on studying this virus in the first place, and who benefits from its release?\n3. The Media Makes Top Dollar from Your Fear Along with America\u2019s other biggest go-nowhere news story of the week, Trump\u2019s impeachment process, the media rakes in huge sums of money from reporting on medical fear stories. Media executives know that people will tune in to watch a deadly virus sweep the globe. The fear that you experience from thinking about the potential for mass quarantine and death, paralyzes and keeps most people locked into consuming more fear-inducing coverage. Hence, more moola for the fat cats at CNN, NBC, etc. Bad news is good for business, and while statistically speaking you should be far more concerned for your safety every time you get into an automobile, nothing gets clicks like fear and panic. 4. Governments Always Seek More Control from Virus Scares What is the logical conclusion for a population of fearful and paralyzed individuals with no experience combatting a new and deadly virus? Giving the authorities more power, of course.. Let the government forcefully inoculate you and your family, allow the medical-industrial complex to take more of your hard-earned money, and watch silently with the fear that standing up for your rights might lead to the destruction of the human race. 5. This Happens Every Few Years and Pushes Important Issues to the Back Page It isn\u2019t hard to find examples of medical hysteria in the past, either. Think back to Ebola , the Swine flu, the regular flu , measles, SARS, or even the plague . Every few years, the media ramps up its coverage of a new virus that often harms a very insignificant number of people. The medical establishment calls for more control, governments call for more control, and important stories get vigorously back-paged. As a nation, we end up wasting valuable time on a non-issue that was never going to matter to begin with, the only net-result being a marked increase in fear and stress.\n6. The Coronavirus Doesn\u2019t Affect You Chances are pretty solid that you won\u2019t even meet someone who was affected in any way by the coronavirus. Statistically, it makes no sense to worry about the virus when you likely know someone personally who was or will be affected by poverty, the drug war , junk food -induced diabetes, opiate addiction, cancer, heart-disease, the looming national debt, war, a lack of clean food or water, stress, taxation, unconstitutional no-knock SWAT raids , pollution , depression, etc. Focusing all of your attention on this new fear is illogical when you consider that we live in a world of daily threats and dangers anyhow. And by the way, spoiler alert\u2026 none of us make it out of here alive. Furthermore, those who are dying from the virus are not actually dying from the virus, but rather from health complications resulting from having the virus and a compromised immune system, like pneumonia. If the national media genuinely wanted you to be safe, they would be running wall-to-wall coverage of how to naturally boost your immune system and get your body into a state of maximum health, but they rarely mention this fact. 7. The Institutions Who Benefit from Coronavirus Hype are Incompetent and Dangerous The institutions, including the CDC, vaccine companies, and media who benefit from coronavirus hype, are incredibly incompetent and dangerous. One might even go so far as to call them diabolical. We all know about the infamous and highly-publicized syphilis experiments that began in the 1930\u2019s, and CDC director Dr. Branda Fitzgerald who was forced to resign in early 2018 after she was caught buying shares of Merck, a major vaccine company that the CDC is supposed to oversee. There\u2019s no shortage of medical corruption in the U.S., both historically and contemporarily, if you look hard enough. Already the pharmaceutical industry is \u2018 racing to develop a vaccine ,\u2019 which when coupled with government mandates equals insane revenue.\n8. Grainy Videos of Dead and Sick-Looking People Are Being Used to Scare You To top it all off, much of the evidence we\u2019re getting from the media is sketchy at best. Earlier, the Daily Star ran a photograph of two men in lab coats, one of which was lying on the ground. The photo is extremely grainy and out of focus. Meanwhile, what are we supposed to make of it? There\u2019s no context here or proof that the photo is really what they say it is. Yet, it was featured in all caps on the drudge report. \u201cDOCTORS COLLAPSE\u201d, it says along with a plethora of other headlines. \u201c Experts fear too late for China \u201d \u201c Everyone will get infected \u201d \u201c Simulation Predicts 65 Million Could Die \u201d Anyone who\u2019s been paying attention could have predicted the rise of the coronavirus and know what the outcome will be. Mass hysteria and collective fear will be used to further erode individual liberties and stoke allegiance to the medical industrial complex. By simply being aware, however, that fearing all the news is illogical, while continuing to focus on your health and wellness, you automatically subvert this attempt at mass control.

And sadly there are already so many idiots out there falling for it, and I have personally seen it for myself!\nYes, there are now supposedly \"81\" victims of this \"deadly\" virus as of the time I am filing this report, primarily in and around the Chinese city of Wuhan, but again that number is so minor in comparison to other diseases out there... But the criminals that run our Jew spew media and our crooked governments cannot let a good \"epidemic\" go to waste\nI for one will continue to find the real truths about this \"virus\" and have them posted at this blog when available...

This was near the end of World War 1. His research looks at three often-cited origins of the disease : (1) The U.S.; (2) France and (3) China. He concludes that China is the site that makes most sense.\nThe insights provided by Professor Humphries in his 2014 research should have accentuated the absolute necessity for health checks on immigrants/migrants coming to Canada\u2014particularly at this time of the Corona virus. A large percentage of Canada\u2019s current immigrants come from China and India whose environments have been described respectively as an \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d and an \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d. Let us translate for the benefit of uninformed Trudeau, ethnic Chinese NDP MP Jenny Kwan, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and a host of equally uninformed MP\u2019s and other politicians : The terms \u201cEnvironmental catastrophe\u201d and \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d mean \u201cbreeding grounds for viruses\u201d. A large percentage of Canada\u2019s immigrants come from those breeding grounds.\nHowever, instead of recognizing the absolute necessity for health checks, Kwan and many other politicians in the past few years have advocated for the abolition of health checks. Consider also that Trudeau \u2018s foolish declaration in 2015 that \u201cCanada would take all refugees\u201d has resulted in Canada taking thousands of fake refugees from Ebola-riddled Nigeria. Finally, note that Trudeau also mined the Russian province of Chechnya in search of gays. Those people are potential carriers of HIV.\nHere are some important details in Professor Humphries\u2019 research that Trudeau, all MP\u2019s and other politicians should note :\n(1) The deadliest epidemics in history have been those which occurred when previously isolated populations came into sustained contact with one another. The three worst were The Plague of Justinian in the Byzantine Empire (541-542 AD), the Black Death in Europe (1347-1400 AD) and the smallpox epidemic in the New \u201cWorld\u201dpopulations (1500 AD +).\n(2) As early as 1914, \u201cpublic health officials feared that a global war might bring new diseases home to civilian populations.\u201d In August, 1914, Canada\u2019s future Surgeon-General, Dr. Guy Carleton Jones, ominously wrote : \u201cThe trail of infected armies leaves a sad tale of sickness amongst the women and children and non-combatants.\u201d (P.56) According to The Canadian Encyclopedia, the Spanish flu (really the Chinese flu) killed about 40,000 Canadians.\n(3) The 1918 Flu started in China but it spread around the world because formerly-isolated, virus-carrying Chinese came into contact with Canadians, Americans, British, French, other Europeans and then Africans who had had little previous contact with one another.\n(4) The contact between the Chinese and other populations happened because the British/French allies in WW1 against Germany needed a large number of workers to do mostly non-combatant work (loading and unloading ships, etc,) behind the front lines of World War 1. The British and the French negotiated with China to bring large numbers of Chinese to Europe. The workers were referred to as the \u201cChinese Labour Corps\u201d When British authorities saw signs of health dangers, they could have reduced the inflow, but felt committed to the Chinese.\n(5) The British asked Canada to help with transporting the Chinese to Europe. Canada agreed. Canada soon accepted the Chinese at its west coast ports (William Head near Victoria first and then Vancouver). It then put the Chinese on CPR trains which took the Chinese to Halifax or to U.S. ports. The Canadian government kept the agreement completely secret. It housed the Chinese in its quarantine facility at William Head. It did examine the Chinese for diseases such as trachoma (a contagious inflammation of the eyelids) and external parasites. It also looked out for signs of flu. When the Chinese were considered ready to leave, they were taken to Vancouver and transferred to trains. It took many cross-country trips to send all the Chinese out. Each train car was guarded by Canadian soldiers and sealed. Dr. James Morton, in his book titled \u201cIn The Sea of Sterile Mountains\u201d, says that about 200,000 Chinese Labour Corps members were transported to Canada\u2019s east coast. (P. 229) The trains stopped in Petawawa, Ontario to give the Chinese labourers a rest and then resumed the trip to Halifax. The Chinese labourers were then moved on to ships which took them to southern England. From England, they were moved to France. One big question that Professor Humphries does not deal with is this : What role did the guards play in spreading the disease when they left their work? Humphries says that during 1917-18 alone, 94,000 Chinese workers were shipped by the British from China. (P.72)\n(6) Professor Humphries says : \u201cWe now know that influenza is caused by a virus which finds its natural home in wild ducks and only infects humans when it crosses the species barrier, sometimes directly passing from birds to people, sometimes passing through an intermediary species such as pigs or horses. When an animal virus becomes a human disease, it has the potential to cause a pandemic because people have no prior immunity. There have been five such episodes in the past 125 years (1889, 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009); the 1918 virus was by far the most severe, and researchers are still not sure why.\u201d (P. 58)\n(7) As with the corona virus now, Chinese medical officials and political authorities downplayed and covered up the extent and severity of the influenza in Northern China where the Chinese labourers lived. They resented the concerns of an international legation (French and British mostly). When one of their own, a Chinese Doctor Wu who had been trained in Europe, agreed with the international legation, they fired him.\n(8) The records of the majority of Chinese Labour Corps units do not appear to have survived in (Canadian ?) archives, but references to the Chinese Labour Corps in the files of other units are informative. The first reports of influenza refer directly to members of the Chinese Labour Corps (April, 2018) .\n(9) British records reported that an epidemic of influenza was in progress in Plymouth, England in late July of 1918. CLC members were there in large numbers. An Australian-built ship, the Mantua which left Plymouth on a trip to Freeport in British west Africa, soon reported that 176 sailors were sick with influenza and pneumonia. Ten sailors died and the disease spread in the city of Freeport. From there, the disease spread down the west coast of Africa. Other ships leaving Europe spread the disease to U.S. ports such as Boston. The disease then spread to all of Massachussetts and New York State. Over the next few months, 675,000 Americans died of influenza or pneumonia.\n(10) The mobilization of the Chinese Labour Corps moved tens of thousands from the interior of northern China where a confirmed outbreak of a virulent respiratory disease had occurred. Let us repeat : The disease eventually killed more then 50 million people. The term \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was used not because the flu originated in Spain, but because Spain kept detailed records on the flu.\n(11) In Humphries words, \u201cThe result (of the migration of the Chinese Labour Corps) was the most deadly disease event in history.\u201d (P.81)\n(12) Would Canadians be far off in labeling Trudeau, his \u201cDiversity is Canada\u2019s strength\u201d policy and a host of Canada\u2019s politicians as Canada\u2019s real \u201cNational Viruses\u201d?", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Globe Food Writers"], "gensraw_title": [[9862, 5911, 7319, 37733]], "probs_title": [[0.00037237064680084586, 0.11382000148296356, 0.00017387887055519968, 0.0001872851134976372]]}

According to the report, some Jews from China sent a question to a special beis din in Bnei Braq established to deal with medical issues and halacha headed by Rav Shmuel Eliezer Stern. These Jews in China are concerned about the spread of this dangerous Corona Virus and want to know if they should continue to go to shul to daven with a minyan or if they should avoid it out of fear of getting infected with the virus? The answer from the beis din was that we have to be more stringent regarding situations of danger than regarding situations of transgressing prohibitions. Ergo, if there is even a slight concern about the virus spreading and getting infected by going to shul,. one should not go to the shul. I guess this means it is not a blanket hetter to stay home, but if in the location where any specific person is there is a valid concern of the virus, one should stay home. If where you are there has been no virus and there is no real concern, then go to shul. Rav Chaim Kanievsky, and other rabbonim, have been asked similar questions and have answered similarly, adding that the professional authorities dealing with the issues should be listened to and instructions followed to avoid getting exposed to the virus.

Matthew Phillips, Esq.\nThe Corona virus is man-made. It\u2019s a laboratory invention. And it\u2019s patented. Disturbing but true.\nClose your eyes. Imagine a world where disease-carrying pathogens are considered \u201cinventions.\u201d Now open your eyes. You live in that world!\nThe U.S. Patent Office indicates that Corona virus is Patent No. US10130701B2 (Nov. 20, 2018). Click on the below link \u2014 and see for yourself \u2014 Corona Patent \u2013> https://patents.google.com/patent/US10130701/en\nWaves of Corona outbreaks are coming soon! But there\u2019s good news \u2014 the Corona vaccine will soon be available at CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens! Just in the nick of time!\nSo, what\u2019s a Corona virus? It\u2019s a virus that reportedly causes runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever . According to WebMD: \u201cIn most cases, you won\u2019t know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s just the common cold.\nBut common cold outbreaks are not scary enough to prompt lawmakers to enact new vaccine mandates. So they crank-up the fear factor with horror movie headlines and apocalyptic images of sinister undertakers dressed in creepy-looking HAZ-MAT outfits!\nAnd when the Corona virus strikes, gov\u2019t authorities will refuse to examine it under a microscope. If they ever do, they\u2019ll immediately recognize the patented LAB strain of the virus \u2014 in every confirmed case \u2014 and it will then be revealed that the LAB strain caused the outbreak!\nYes, folks are being infected with the LAB strain of the virus. But if this fact ever leaks-out, the Corona Caper will unravel. So the authorities LIE to us. They claim the outbreaks are caused by elusive, WILD strains of the virus. But remember, Corona virus is an \u201cinvention.\u201d There is no WILD strain of the virus!\nThe mainstream media have already begun their Corona disinformation campaign. Gov\u2019t lapdogs at USA Today report on what they call \u201cbogus theories\u201d that the Corona virus is patented. Um, okay, \u2014 but it * is * patented. Not a \u201ctheory!\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cfactoid\u201d capable of verification at the U.S. Patent Office.\nAccording to USA Today , the Corona patent is just a social media myth. But USA Today is a fake news peddler! They get paid to run \u201cads\u201d alongside their news stories. And the more ad revenue they receive, the more fake their stories become. Fake News from USA Today \u2013> https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/25/wuhan-coronavirus-bogus-conspiracy-theory-spreads-social-media/4569180002/ Despite the disinformation, the Corona virus is indeed patented \u2014 which makes it readily identifiable and distinct from WILD strains. The gov\u2019t clearly has the means to discern whether victims are catching the LAB strain or a WILD strain, but the gov\u2019t just doesn\u2019t care to investigate. They already know which strain sparked the outbreak! After all, it was the gov\u2019t that awarded the patent in the first place! (Wink-wink!)\nWhen Corona outbreaks visit your town (and they will) tell your local health inspectors that Corona \u201ctest kits\u201d yield only positive or negative test results, i.e ., they never reveal the actual viral strain.\nWhen they announce Corona outbreaks, insist that officials examine blood samples under a microscope \u2014 to determine whether the outbreak involves the LAB strain or a WILD strain.\nHey! There\u2019s a Quest Diagnostics lab on every street corner in America! There\u2019s no reason to avoid scrutinizing the Corona virus under a microscope! But mainstream science has no wish to study, research, or gain understanding about the origins of infectious outbreaks or how they spread. Mainstream science is too busy creating fear and panic \u2014 to sell more vaccines.\nOnce you see the fraud in how they \u201cconfirm\u201d the identity of the virus that supposedly caused the outbreak, you suddenly see the fraud in the outbreak itself. All outbreak hoaxes unravel once you realize that \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases of the dreaded disease are never actually \u201cconfirmed\u201d under a microscope.\nConsider this \u2014 many scientists are employed as \u201cvirus hunters.\u201d Their only job is to search for new viruses. If they find one \u2014 they quickly bring it into captivity \u2014 to patent it! Capitalism has a way of turning nature into commodities! And yet, whenever there\u2019s an infectious outbreak, presumably caused by new, WILD viruses, nobody ever goes hunting for these new, WILD viruses! (Get it?)\nPredictably, the unvaccinated will be blamed for the Corona outbreaks. Kristen Bell will blame the heathen parents of unclean, ungodly, and unvaccinated children who aren\u2019t caught-up on their Corona boosters, right?! But wait a sec\u2019\u2014 how can Sarah Marshall blame the unvaccinated for Corona outbreaks \u2014 when all Americans are unvaccinated for Coronal Disease? (\u201cShh!\u201d Don\u2019t ask!)\nIf they ever examined, under a microscope, blood samples from Corona victims, they\u2019d plainly see that all were infected with the LAB strain of the virus! And they cleverly conceal this fact with test kits that test only for exposure to the virus \u2014 and which never identify the culprit viral strain! (Are you paying attention?)\nGuess what? Ebola virus is patented. AIDS virus is patented. Measles virus is patented. And so is Chickenpox virus, Zika virus, SARS virus, MRSA virus, Avian flu virus, etc . Any virus you can name \u2014 it\u2019s patented. All viruses now in captivity are patented.\nAnd all Corona outbreaks are staged media events! For goodness\u2019 sake \u2014 no Corona outbreaks exist in the historical record!\nRemember when your mom told you how to care for diseases like Mumps, Measles and Coronas? Remember that time you stayed home from school for a week with a bad case of the Coronas? NO! Because the Corona virus never existed until Bill Gates paid some slob to invent it \u2014 so they can have more outbreaks \u2014 so they can sell more vaccines \u2014 so they can kill-off more useless eaters \u2014 so they can roll-out their new world order! \u201cIf we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, and reproductive health services, we could lower world population by 10 or 15 percent.\u201d\u2013 Bill Gates\nYou guessed it! Bill Gates owns the patented Corona virus! And, not surprisingly, Bill Gates also own the rights to the anti-Corona virus vaccine!\nThe recent Corona outbreaks, which follow closely on the heels of the patent approval, is another c-o-n-s-p-i-r-a-c-y . (There! I said it!) But this should be evident from the intensive media coverage, which is calculated to scare you half to death! Be afraid! Be very afraid! Fear sells vaccines!\nCorona outbreaks will scare lawmakers into enacting Corona vaccine mandates! Next thing ya know, they will patent a Heineken virus! So expect Heineken outbreaks \u2014 and then Heineken vaccines! This is how they do the masses. This is how the vaccine holocaust begins! This is what genocide looks like!\nThis is how they plan to exterminate seven billion useless eaters. There\u2019s no need for gas chambers when vaccines will do the job nice and neat \u2014 and nobody will even know it\u2019s a holocaust.\nThe downward spiral comes quickly \u2014 the time to resist is now. Just remember, it\u2019s easier to genocide a population \u2014 than to convince them they\u2019re being genocided.

Christianity is not the creed of Asia and Africa at this moment solely because the seventh century Christians of Asia and Africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the Moslems were trained to fight.Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought. If the peoples of Europe in the seventh and eighth centuries, an on up to and including the seventeenth century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the Mohammedans who invaded Europe, Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated. Wherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, Christianity has ultimately disappeared. From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Sobieski, Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor. \u2026..The civilization of Europe, American and Australia exists today at all only because of the victories of civilized man over the enemies of civilization because of victories through the centuries from Charles Martel in the eighth century and those of John Sobieski in the seventeenth century. During the thousand years that included the careers of the Frankish soldier and the Polish king, the Christians of Asia and Africa proved unable to wage successful war with the Moslem conquerors; and in consequence Christianity practically vanished from the two continents; and today, nobody can find in them any \u201csocial values\u201d whatever, in the sense in which we use the words, so far as the sphere of Mohammedan influences are concerned.There are such \u201csocial values\u201d today in Europe, America and Australia only because during those thousand years, the Christians of Europe possessed the warlike power to do what the Christians of Asia and Africa had failed to do \u2014 that is, to beat back the Moslem invader. victorious with terror \" I have been made victorious with terror\" Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \"I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand.\" Abu Huraira added: Allah's Apostle has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them).

This is the single biggest impetus to Islamist terrorism. We all have to grasp that terrorism is not the biggest threat we face. The biggest threat is the ideology that drives it. It\u2019s not enough to fight terror, vital though that is. The principal battleground is the world of ideas, the battle for hearts and minds. The Islamists see this very clearly. They understand that psychological warfare \u2014 the fomenting of paranoia, resentment, hysteria, and demoralization \u2014 is their most effective weapon.

It's also beneficial for doctors to explain the condition to patients and the government.\nAt present, we have 3D printed a new model of coronavirus lung infection case, which will be delivered to relevant hospitals for research and communication. The bilateralism of the peripheral lung opacities, without subpleural sparing, are common CT findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.\nOur modeling is based on a lung lesion that was diagnosed about 5 days after the infection. After the 3D reconstruction of the CT image of the lesion to obtain model data, it is printed using a full-color 3D printer. We use the Polyjet technology Stratasys J750 3D printer to print, adjust the Shore hardness to adjust the soft hardness, adjust the different transparency and color to build a realistic and vivid model of coronavirus lung infection case.\nThis medical lesion model is modeled under the guidance of relevant doctors and will be sent to the hospital for research by experts in the respiratory field. It is convenient for them to explain the case entity analysis as well as the evolution process. New coronavirus model data has been mapped in medical institutions in Wuhan and Shanghai. After revising the data, the virus models can be 3D printed for medical use. 3D printing technology can quickly assist in the analysis of physical model evolution and the delivery of physical models in the field of medical emergencies. By 3D modeling of the new coronavirus, we can clearly know its crystal structure, gene structure, etc.\nThe 3D printed model will help scientists to conduct better research. For the presentation of intersecting complex structures in medical models, as long as the 3D model is designed, it can be printed using transparent/translucent/full-color 3D printing technology.

Posts Realtime Corona Virus Tracker on Its Website", "text": "HealthLynked Corp. (OTCQB: HLYK), a nationwide healthcare network focused on care management of its members and a provider of healthcare technologies that connects doctors, patients and medical data today announced that to help its members keep track of the deadly corona virus epidemic, it has provided a GEO tracker of cases reported by the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") in the US and worldwide.\nThe company plans to release an updated version this month that will allow members to report symptoms and provide a way for the public to more closely track symptoms, areas of potential exposure, confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases, and track the outbreak so that they can better prepare and protect themselves from exposure.\nThe first infection with 2019-nCoV in the United States was reported on January 21, 2020 . The current count of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV in the United States and globally can be monitored at www.healthlynked.com/corona-virus-tracker .\nAbout the Corona Virus:\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a new virus that causes respiratory illness in people and can spread from person-to-person. This virus originated in Wuhan , China and likely originally emerged from an animal source but now seems to be spreading from person-to-person. It is important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.\nAt this time, it is unclear how easily this virus is spreading between people, but concerns are that individuals that are infected can spread the virus before symptoms occur and after they have recovered. You can learn more of what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses at\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html .\nThe greatest risk of infection is for people in China or people who have traveled to China . Risk of infection is dependent on exposure. Patients with 2019-nCoV have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: fever, cough and shortness of breath with many patients having developed pneumonia in both lungs.\nThe best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. There are simple everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including the following:\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. If you are sick, to keep from spreading respiratory illness to others, you should:\nStay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. If you were in China within the past 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or are having difficulty breathing, you should get medical care. Call the office of your health care provider before you go and tell them about your recent travels and your symptoms. They will give you instructions on how to get care without exposing other people to your illness. While sick, avoid contact with people, don't go out and delay any travel to reduce the possibility of spreading illness to others.\nThere is currently no vaccine to protect against 2019-nCoV. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus.\nDr. Michael Dent , HealthLynked CEO stated \"The Corona Virus infection is a global health crisis and helping identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus and can infect others is the primary method to prevent further spread. The WHO provides updated statistics on new confirmed infections. So far in the US there are only 8 confirmed cases, but concerns are high that the virus will spread in the US as it has in China. We strongly encourage everyone to create a free HealthLynked profile so that they have easy access to their medical information in case they require medical attention.\"\n\"Wearing a protective mask is one way to reduce exposure to airborne virus and they are in short supply.

But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silence \u2026 until panic breaks out.\nThe worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially \u2014 in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate \u2014 until they run out of susceptible victims.\nIn 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in four years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.\nSince then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight.\nAs in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.\nAccurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.\nThere can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases, while countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine writes, \u201cAnother Decade, Another Coronavirus.\u201d This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.\nThis virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill, but even there is unlikely to be effective, especially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.\nA report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet, showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread.\nThe corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nIn a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masks, regular surgical masks are probably of little help.\nPanic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.\nIndividuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family\u2019s and their community\u2019s survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own.\nFor now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly. https://www.galioninquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2020/02/web1_JaneM.OrientM.D.jpg\nJane M.

But how do these global issues actually affect Spain and Catalonia in general and Barcelona in particular?\nBrexit finally went through last Friday night after 3 years of back and forth, and has of course been closely followed even here in Catalonia for obvious reasons, as a possible Catalan independence would naturally spiral the new country out of the European Union \u2013 which of course might be considered by some as just a drop in the ocean in the big picture. Then again the bittersweet divorce between Great Britain and Europe has shown that despite a big part of the population being partial to a quick reunion the majority still counts and the results are always more or less uncertain. So with talks between the Catalan and Spanish government coming up as well as new election due in Catalonia soon, this is a very interesting issue.\nThe other headline of the week, the fast spreading deadly corona-virus originating from China, has been the other topic of the street even here in Spain, where no actual cases of infections have yet been reported. At the moment it seems like some alarmed parts of the population have so far mostly managed to block many emergency rooms, and the authorities are trying to calm things down and keep the panic away. Spain has also evacuated all its citizens willing to leave the epicenter and they are now being kept in a 2 week quarantine in a hospital, while media is covering the events closely.\nBarcelona has her own decisions to make regarding this fast-spreading virus with the Mobile World Congress coming up soon.

Liver and kidney problems can also develop.\nWhat\u2019s more, if the coronavirus mutates to a more virulent form, it can weaken a cat\u2019s immune system to the point the infection spreads throughout the body, often resulting in death.\nSo can colloidal silver help heal sick cats of FIP? The answer might surprise you\u2026\nA Startling Testimonial\nA Micro-Particle Colloidal Silver Generator user wrote me to say that he\u2019d saved his cat from FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) using one eye dropper full of colloidal silver several times a day.\nQuote: :\n\u201cUsing the \u201cstandard\u201d colloidal silver concentration produced during a three-hour generation from our Micro-Particle Colloidal Silver Generator, we have successfully \u201ccured\u201d two different infections that conventional medicine has not consistently addressed.\n\u201cIn particular, Bruiser, our Japanese Bobtail, was sentenced to certain death by a local vet who declared that the kitty\u2019s illness indicated by lab tests was FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) and was incurable.\nThree other vets confirmed the FIP and the death sentence, including an area alternative medicine vet who refused my suggestion to try colloidal silver, and \u201cabused\u201d the kitty with vitamin shots (to no avail).\n\u201cFor the first few months after Bruiser\u2019s veterinarians failed to successfully address the FIP, my wife and I gave him an eyedropper full (approximately 1 teaspoon) several times daily. His appetite improved quickly and he started playing with his sister again, so we reduced the dosage to several times a week.\n\u201cBruiser is now another five years older (total six+ years) and is well and healthy. We occasionally fill an eye dropper and give him a drink if he seems to be feeling lethargic.\n\u201cWe feel that colloidal silver performed miraculously, where conventional \u2018cat medicine\u2019 and veterinarians failed the test.\n\u201cTwo young teens in our neighborhood find the same formula very effective in controlling their acne. The best testimony stems from their respective mothers coming back for more!\u201d\n\u2014 Dale T., CO\nSo you\u2019ll never convince Bruiser\u2019s owner that colloidal silver doesn\u2019t work for FIP.\nControversy\nYet, oddly, people who run online FIP support groups consistently denigrate the use of colloidal silver for cats with FIP, even when people write in and say they successfully used it on their cats and cured the FIP.\nIndeed, virtually every single time a colloidal silver user posts a success story about helping their cat heal from FIP, people from online FIP groups begin posting negative comments like \u201cTake your cat to a vet\u201d and \u201ccolloidal silver is dangerous\u201d and \u201cyour cat probably didn\u2019t really have FIP.\u201d\nOne lady even chastised another lady who had used colloidal silver to heal her cat of FIP, by saying, \u201cGiving cats colloidal silver for FIP takes much-needed resources away from fighting the virus.\u201d\nOf course, there\u2019s no clinical documentation whatsoever provided for that claim. It\u2019s just an emotional claim, with no basis in fact. And it flies in the face of the experiences of thousands of people who have successfully given their pets \u2014 cats, dogs, horses, birds, reptiles and others \u2014 colloidal silver to help fight and/or prevent infections.\nSo, using colloidal silver to help a cat with FIP might be a bit controversial, depending upon who you ask. But I\u2019ve heard from more than one cat lover who said it worked for them like gangbusters, and with no side effects whatsoever.\nMore Testimonials\nHere\u2019s another case in which colloidal silver apparently cured a nasty case of FIP:\nHi Steve! I wanted to give you a update on \u2018Ditto,\u2019 my kitten with FIP.\nHe\u2019s been on the Silver since last year. He should be a year old around May, they aren\u2019t sure when he was born.

Women, whether from China, Italy or the U.S., have been less likely to become acutely ill \u2014 and far more likely to survive. Which has made doctors wonder: Could hormones produced in greater quantities by women be at work? Now scientists on two coasts, acting quickly on their hunches in an effort to save men\u2019s lives, are testing the hypothesis. The two clinical trials will each dose men with the sex hormones for limited durations. Last week, doctors on Long Island in New York started treating Covid-19 patients with estrogen in an effort to increase their immune systems, and next week, physicians in Los Angeles will start treating male patients with another hormone that is predominantly found in women, progesterone, which has anti-inflammatory properties and can potentially prevent harmful overreactions of the immune system. \u201cThere\u2019s a striking difference between the number of men and women in the intensive care unit, and men are clearly doing worse,\u201d said Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care physician at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles who is the principal investigator for the progesterone study. She said 75 percent of the hospital\u2019s intensive care patients and those on ventilators are men. And pregnant women, who are usually immunocompromised but have high levels of estrogen and progesterone, tend to have mild courses of the disease. \u201cSo something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,\u201d Dr. Ghandehari said. Some experts who study sex differences in immunity, however, warned that hormones may fail to be the magic bullet that some are hoping for; even elderly women with Covid-19 are outliving their male peers, and there is a drastic reduction in levels of hormones for women after menopause. The genesis of the estrogen trial at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island stemmed from a similar observation, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the trial\u2019s principal investigator, who credited a Stony Brook surgeon, Dr. Anthony Gasparis, with the idea. The trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,\u201d said Dr. Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York. The gender gap in coronavirus survival became apparent early in the pandemic. Reports from China indicated men were dying at higher rates, but the disparity was attributed to higher smoking rates. But the outcomes were consistent in other countries, with men in Italy dying at higher rates than women, and men in New York City dying at nearly double the rate of women. Scientists who study sex differences say that both biological differences in immunity, as well as behavioral factors are at play. Men smoke more almost everywhere, they say; men also wash their hands less. While women appear to have more robust immune systems, these experts say, the causes are complex and multifactorial, and hormones are only part of the picture. If such sex hormones were the primary protective factor for women, then elderly women with Covid-19 would fare as poorly as elderly men, because women\u2019s reproductive hormones plummet after menopause, said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But that\u2019s not the case, she said. \u201cWe see this bias across the life course,\u201d Dr. Klein said. \u201cOlder men are still disproportionately affected, and that suggests to me it\u2019s got to be something genetic, or something else, that\u2019s not just hormonal.\u201d \u201cEstrogen has immune modulatory properties \u2014 don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou could get a beneficial effect in both men and women. But if women are better at recovery at 93 years old, I doubt it\u2019s hormones.\u201d Research has shown estrogen may have an effect on a protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for example. The coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells as an entry route, and ACE2 is regulated differently in men and women, said Kathryn Sandberg, director of the Center for the Study of Sex Differences in Health, Aging and Disease at Georgetown University. In studies with rats, Dr. Sandberg and her colleagues have shown that estrogen can reduce ACE2 protein expression in their kidneys, so it is possible the hormone may reduce ACE2 expression in men as well. Dr. Nachman said, \u201cWe may not understand exactly how estrogen works, but maybe we can see how the patient does,\u201d adding that estrogen played a complex role, both in the early immune response that could help clear a viral infection, as well as in a secondary clean up or repair response, which could evolve into a cytokine storm. \u201cWhile we see women do get infected, their responses are different,\u201d Dr. Nachman said. \u201cWe see fewer of them having the second, disregulated immune response.\u201d The Stony Brook estrogen trial is recruiting 110 patients who come to the hospital\u2019s emergency room with symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia, and who have either tested positive for Covid-19 or are presumed to have the illness, as long as they do not require intubation. The trial is open to adult men as well as to women aged 55 and older, since they have low levels of estrogen. Half of the participants will be given an estradiol patch for one week, while the other half will serve as a control group, and researchers will follow them to see whether estrogen reduces the severity of their disease. The Cedars-Sinai study is smaller, with only 40 subjects, all men, half of whom will be a control group. Only hospital inpatients with mild to moderate disease who have tested positive for Covid-19 can participate. (Patients with certain conditions, like a history of blood clots, are excluded for safety reasons.) The patients will get two shots of progesterone a day for five days. They will be monitored to see if their status is improving, how their needs for oxygen change and whether they go on to require intensive care or mechanical ventilation; their progress will be compared to patients in the control group. The researchers in Los Angeles are pinning their hopes on progesterone rather than estrogen because research has shown that the hormone reduces pro-inflammatory immune cells, and supports those that fight inflammation, Dr. Ghandehari said. The hypothesis is that progesterone will prevent or dampen a harmful overreaction of the immune system, called a cytokine storm, and will reduce the likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both hormones are believed to be safe, especially when used for short durations. Participants will be warned of possible side effects that may be a first for many men, like tenderness in the breast and hot flashes.

He sang throughout his life, as a boy in a church choir in Massachusetts; as a student in the University of Notre Dame Glee Club; and as a tenor in the Oratorio Society of Washington, now the Washington Chorus, which performs at the Kennedy Center and other such lofty venues. Though he came of age with rock-and-roll in the 1950s, he preferred the jazz of Dave Brubeck, Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan.\n\u201cHe went to the Newport Jazz Festival many times,\u201d said the younger Jackman, a reporter for The Washington Post, \u201cnot to mention far less savory jazz joints.\u201d\nWilliam E. \u201cBill\u201d Jackman, 85, a retired press spokesman who loved to travel the world with his wife of 60 years, died this week in an assisted-living facility in Reston, Va., after testing positive for covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus .

For a few years, he edited a small newspaper in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, then entered the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Va. Around that time, he met a young Virginia woman named Sigrid Stanley, who was studying at Mary Washington University in nearby Fredericksburg.\nAD AD \u201cIt was a big deal that she married a Yankee,\u201d Tom Jackman said of his mother. He said each family had trouble understanding the other\u2019s accent.\nOver the years, the couple\u2019s travels included trips to China, India, Kenya, Australia and Brazil. They had two sons and a daughter.\nFor about 23 years starting in the mid-1960s, Bill Jackman, who left the Marines as a captain, was a spokesman for the airline industry\u2019s trade association, now called Airlines for America. Later, until he retired in the mid-2000s, he was national spokesman for AAA.\n\u201cIf you know me or my brother, you knew him, because he passed his passions directly to us,\u201d Tom Jackman said.\nAD Sports, for instance: Besides being an avid spectator, Bill Jackman was the public address announcer \u2014 the stadium voice \u2014 of U.S. Navy Academy football for three decades.

Add to that, heavily polluted toxic air (as in Wuhan and other Chinese cities). Add in extreme malnutrition. YOU DON\u2019T NEED A CORONAVIRUS TO EXPLAIN CASES OF PNEUMONIA IN CHINA.\nAll right. So how many deaths from pneumonia occurred in China well before the \u201cappearance of the coronavirus?\u201d\nEstimates vary. Here is one, based on an analysis of studies: 2.8 million to 17 million deaths per year. Source: \u201cPneumonia Incidence and Mortality in Mainland China: Systematic Review of Chinese and English Literature, 1985-2008\u201d (PLoS one, 2010).\nNotice the dates\u20141985-2008, long before the supposed coronavirus showed up. Before 5G technology, before a biowar research lab ramped up in Wuhan.\n2.8 million to 17 million deaths. No need for a mysterious virus.\nThe wide variance in these death numbers is the result of trying to integrate Chinese language and English language studies, the huge expanse of territory in China, the huge population, and possible attempts, within China, to conceal true statistics.\nWhat does all this tell us? It tells us that now, there is a gigantic pool of people with pneumonia, in China, who can be falsely labeled \u201cdeaths from the coronavirus.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s not all. There are other categories of illness that can be merged with pneumonia, in the rush to diagnose people with the coronavirus. I\u2019m talking about \u201clower lung infections\u201d and \u201cinfluenza.\u201d The mortality numbers leap even higher.\nYou might rightly ask, \u201cSo why hasn\u2019t pneumonia, all by itself, been labeled an epidemic in China in past years? Why hasn\u2019t the World Health Organization, at the very least, declared a state of emergency for China based on pneumonia?\u201d\nYou can bet your bottom dollar that, if the \u201ccoronavirus epidemic\u201d was said to reach 2 million deaths in China, the entire planet would be locked down tight, and no one anywhere would leave home. Both atheists and end-times prophets would be shouting that the extinction of all human life was upon us. Persons in high places would be meeting and saying the only solution was to nuke Earth and start over.\nLet\u2019s consider, for a moment, how easy it would be to label pneumonia outside China with the coronavirus tag. As in, \u201cthe virus is spreading everywhere.\u201d Here is a quote: \u201c[Globally] About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year\u2014100 million in children and 100 million in adults.\u201d Lancet, volume 377, ISSUE 9773, P1264-1275, April 09, 2011.\nBut wait, you say. Pneumonia is only called \u201ccoronavirus\u201d if the patient is tested and the virus is discovered. Otherwise, it\u2019s just ordinary pneumonia. \u2014Sorry, it\u2019s not that simple.\nFirst of all, in the pressure of an announced epidemic, all sorts of people who have elevated temperature and general flu-like symptoms will be called coronavirus cases. Metrics people will use computer models to estimate numbers of cases. And even when the most widely used diagnostic tests are done\u2014those tests have serious flaws.\nAn antibody test, at best, only indicates the patient has come in contact with the virus. It says nothing about whether he is going to become ill. In fact, before 1984, a positive-reading antibody test was generally taken to mean the patient was in good shape. His immune system had defeated the germ in question. But then, after 1984, the science was turned on its head\u2014and a positive test was falsely taken to mean the patient was ill or would soon become ill.\nThe so-called PCR test (which has many procedural problems and requires expert technicians who will not make mistakes) takes a tiny, tiny sample of what might be a virus from a patient, and blows it up many, many times so it can be observed. However, in order for this virus to actually cause illness, millions and millions of virus particles must be present in the patient\u2019s body. The PCR test says nothing reliable about quantity of virus in a person.\nTherefore, even when these tests are done on suspected cases of the coronavirus, they do not result in accurate knowledge about illness and disease.\nIf you\u2019re beginning to think it\u2019s easy to declare an epidemic and broadcast propaganda about it, you\u2019re right. Take a conventional set of symptoms present in people all over the world, claim a new virus is causing them, and you\u2019re off and running. You can report 500 or 1000 deaths from this virus and people will believe whatever you say or do next. They won\u2019t realize that this set of symptoms has been present in millions and millions of people, for decades or centuries, without the new virus. They won\u2019t realize millions of people have already died without the \u201cnew virus.\u201d\nGlobal epidemics solely based on germ-pronouncements, without environmental investigations (contaminated water supplies, open sewage, hunger, starvation, poverty, toxic chemicals, etc.), are industries. They\u2019re business ventures. They\u2019re operations launched to control populations and force them to take vaccines. They\u2019re launched and sustained by professional liars, who\u2019ve refined the old skills of snake oil salesmen through the use of \u201cscience,\u201d in order to hypnotize the unwary. And when the vaccine of the moment\u2014as in the Swine Flu epidemic duds of 1976 and 2009\u2014turns out to be quite damaging, the snake oil pros say, \u201cWell, every vaccine can cause rare problems, but all in all, they curb pandemics. We must inject them.\u201d\nIf you automatically buy that one, you believe pigs can jump over the moon on the backs of cows.\nHighly educated people do tend to believe pigs can jump over the moon, when it comes to so-called epidemics. They think, \u201cI admire complex issues. Epidemics and viruses are very complex, and only the well-trained and sophisticated professionals can assess them. Therefore, these pros know what they\u2019re doing. I reject THE SIMPLE.\u201d\nBut THE SIMPLE is what these people need to know about. Otherwise, it\u2019s still pigs, the moon, cows, and jumping.\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026but this situation in China is NEW and UNPRECEDENTED, as of 2019. It\u2019s never happened before. And the lockdowns and the quarantines\u2026So there must be a new explanation, the coronavirus.\u201d\nIf necessary, read this article again. The pneumonia-situation is not new. And the lockdowns and quarantines were theatrically laid on AFTER the blaring trumpet announcements of the \u201cepidemic.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still over the moon.\n", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Get rid of this"], "gensraw_title": [[3856, 5756, 287, 429]], "probs_title": [[0.00016521761426702142, 0.04078466072678566, 0.993743360042572, 0.1521984338760376]]}

I didn\u2019t take it seriously at all \u2013 a contrasting approach from the time of hypervigilance during the swine flu breakout when I would smother myself in hand sanitizer the moment I heard the faintest cough. I knew it was nothing but a medical fad to satisfy people\u2019s absurd apocalyptical fantasies and wanted no part of it. After all, I never got around to watching The Walking Dead so I was nowhere near as enthusiastically freaked out about this apparently deadly virus as others.\nA few days passed and I continued to walk into my internship, went into some mild coughing fits, and conversed with my colleague about her holiday plans. She mentioned she would go back to her hometown, and upon inquiring where that was, she casually answered Wuhan. \u201c Cool \u201d I shrugged before helping myself to another one of her French fries.\nYes, those were the peaceful days when there was no segregation between the Wuhanese and the rest. The days when a slight cough would not result in massive public unrest followed by an immediate evacuation of the premises. Yes, those were the days.\nI was on my way home from my internship one evening when I noticed a sudden emergence of a peculiar fashion trend centered around face-wear: masks. Every where I looked, all I saw were people covered in hideous masks which made me reflexively roll my eyes twenty times. I went on to meet my flatmates for dinner, only to notice they themselves were shivering with worry, saying all sorts of things in their theatrical French accents which helped further dramatize the mood.\n\u201c j\u2019you j\u2019know\u2026. Une of our classmates left the countrY due to the err.. the virUs \u201d said a flatmate who\u2019ll be referred to as Mademoiselle Rossignol. I let out a loud, inelegant laugh which attracted disgusted looks from the waiters, and then I realised I was the only one cackling like a hyena on steroids and everyone else was not amused. \u201c No way! \u201d I spat out \u201c Surely, that\u2019s an overreaction! \u201d \u201c j\u2019you\u2026 never know\u2026. J\u2019you know 4 pepel already dead! \u201d chirped Mademoiselle Rossignol in the typical French accent whereby she rose the pitch of her voice towards the end of sentence and, therefore, finished a line about death on a somewhat perky note. \u201c do j\u2019you know where, err, j\u2019we can buy ,err, masks? \u201d asked another Frenchie who\u2019ll go by the name of Jean Paul. \u201c And, err, j\u2019hand sanatIsers! \u201d added another who we\u2019ll call Croissant.\nLike an assuring godmother, I calmly told them all that we can set out to buy masks and hand sanitizers together after we finish our dinner, and that\u2019s exactly what we went on to do with me leading the group as I wore an amused expression and tried my best not to giggle at all this ridiculousness. It wasn\u2019t long before we arrived at the nearest health store and I gave my flatmates a smug look as if I was about to perform a cool trick of locating some masks and hand sanatisers and wanted them to applaud when I finally did it. I proceeded into the shop with a determined look and, in a true terminator style, scanned everywhere for these products, but was eventually told by the staff that they were sold out.\nI paused for a while as it took some time for the words to fully sink in. Sold out?! In the two years that I have been living in China, I never heard the words \u201csold out\u201d in relation to masks, let alone small bottles of hand-santisers. I felt this to be insanely bizarre but felt comfort knowing we were in the heart of Shanghai which was loaded with shops and commercial centers, so we simply dashed to another store. Also sold out. Then another. Sold out too. Another. Sold out. Every single shop we checked was out of both masks and hand santisers, and this is what launched me into a state of panic.\nI paused to catch my breath and let myself drink in this situation of doom, like the realization when you took too many caffeine pills and are just waiting for yourself to explode. I saw my flatmates all had tucked their heads in the edges of their top so it could function as a mask. I noticed how the center of Shanghai was rather empty. Those that were around were all wearing masks and anxiously scuttering around. I felt my hands shake\u2026 maybe because my phone was vibrating. It was a phone call from Mommajandro. \u201c THIS IS INTERNATIONAL NEWS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU WEARING A MASK?! \u201d screamed Mommajandro the moment I answered the call. Mommajando has only one way of communicating with others and that is through shouting. \u201c they are all sold out\u2026 \u201d \u201c WHAT SOLD OUT. I TOLD YOU AT THE VERY BEGINNING TO GET MASKS \u201d. This is one of her classic moves whereby she reinvents the past to support her \u2018I told you so\u2019 narrative, when in actuality, she did no such thing. \u201c You said you don\u2019t even like the idea of wearing masks in public \u201d \u201c SHUT UP \u201d\nThe phone call with Mommajandro only served to make me freak out further and I was fully preparing myself for a heart attack or an epileptic seizure. As soon as I arrived in the apartment with my flatmates, a light bulb went off in my head and I became Jesus, ordering us all a mask through a Chinese takeout app.\nThat was the first time when I began to grasp the severity of the situation and realized I should be more worried than I was at the time. Wuhan Corona Virus\nSaid to have originated in an illegal wildlife market in Wuhan, freaking out over this virus is totally the latest trend! From what I understand, if you cough and have a fever, it\u2019s game over.\nOr you may just have a common cold as the symptoms of the cold are said to be identical to those of nCOV. This is precisely why when I did a cute little sneeze in the elevator the other day, all the people inside began fidgeting and sweating nervously, desperately hoping the doors would open soon so they could escape.\nThe virus is spreading at an alarming rate and Wuhan is under quarantine, but as the numbers rise, so do worries. People are limiting contact with everyone and everything, abandoning pets and in some cases, children. The Current Situation\nRight now, it\u2019s as if I am trapped in a high-rise tower like Rapunzel in the modern, apocalyptic version of Disney\u2019s Tangled. Mommajandro had taken the role of Mother Gothel as she would scream warnings through the phone every morning to ensure I do not leave the apartment. On top of that, there are the spam messages from the university which are also in-line with Mommjandro\u2019s thoughts. I only occasionally leave the apartment to take my food delivery and even then my fashion-freedom is restricted, thanks to the importance placed on protective clothing over style.\nThis virus has and continues to ruin everything.\nLet\u2019s start with the fact that I live at the heart of Shanghai \u2013 only 10 minutes walk from the bund, and a few minutes from the iconic East Nanjing Road which is equivalent to Times Square in New York \u2014 and yet, I can\u2019t enjoy any of it because of this killjoy virus.\nThis level of quarantine wasn\u2019t something that happened overnight where I woke up and just decided it would be fun to trap myself, but it was rather a smooth transition. After our discovery of the mask shortage, I was still chill about going out to eat and meeting friends but I soon realised others didn\u2019t share my way of thinking. The usually bustling downtown area of the city suddenly went full-on silent with only a few people walking by. Even the street vendors who would usually yell at the top of their lungs whenever anyone would pass by, had surprisingly sealed their mouth shut.\nI would send pictures of dishes at restaurants to friends who, rather than replying with a supportive \u201cLooks yummy!\u201d, would question my sanity that I was still out during this time and tell me to go home or to the nearest mental institution. The subways were quiet with only a few people there, mostly staff workers and old people who clearly did not fear death. There was a time when an unmasked guy approached me and began speaking, resulting in me panicking and running away, only to look back and notice the guy was chasing after me.\nThere was a time when I was strolling around with music in my ear phones, looking for a restaurant, and then a song came on with lyrics as follows: I am walking in the wrong lane to a place unknown My head is filled with you, I am in my comfort zone But when I ring your bell, I see you\u2019ve left me alone. Where are you? I am wondering what to do? I am missing you, try to call your phone but you left me in the cold. THE STREETS ARE LONELY!! ! THE DARKNESS CLOSING IN ON ME. I AM JUST CIRCLING AROUND\u2026. AROUND AND AROUND\u2026. The timing of the song couldn\u2019t be more befitting to the situation at the time because it turns out that while I was looking for a restaurant to eat, I was actually circling around and around the same area. I freaked out, removed my earphones and sought refuge in the nearest restaurant.\nThen the death tolls continued to rise.\nMore messages came in.\nAnd phone calls.\nAnd rumours.\nAll of these little things added up and skyrocketed my blood pressure, leading me to eventually make the final decision of putting myself under quarantine. Others\u2019 take on the Situation\nThis pandemic has incited varying responses from different types of people, ranging from not leaving the room to leaving the entire country.\nLet\u2019s start with Ren\u00e9e. If you read the previous blog-post regarding my travels with Ren\u00e9e, you would know she is someone deeply cherished by Jesus due to her unbelievable level of luck that she attributes to her belief in Jesus Christ. And so do I. This leads me to think that while everyone is counting on their own government to make a move, this woman probably has divine protection and Jesus has most likely already granted her full immunity from the virus. Despite this, she has taken strictest of measures in the student dormitory in Suzhou, isolating herself from the student group , rejecting invitations to any parties. I know better than to ignore any advice she has to offer so the moment she told me to get some vodka as a rumoured preventative measure against the virus, I put all my suspicions aside and simply ordered a bottle. May Jesus extend his protection to me too.\nOther students in my university are leaving the country or have already left and delayed their return to China.\nMy flatmate, Mademoiselle Rossignol, decided to follow the footsteps of her classmate and also get out of the country. She has already booked a flight to sweep her away to France. Despite this, she didn\u2019t want to leave without a final party, holding it in our flat inviting some heavy coughers for a fun night! They probably had the common cold (or so we hope.)\nOthers are also not letting the virus ruin their fun, holding house parties but with some conditions attached. Oksanochka N\u00ebntori Hujati\nBut while most people are taking preventative measures, there is one particular student in our programme who simply refuses to give a fuck, and has taken advantage of the situation to visit all the scenic spots which would usually be crowded if not for the virus. Introducing Oksanochka N\u00ebntori Hujati.\nAs a Chernobyl survivor, Oksanochka N\u00ebntori Hujati has seen it all and remains unfettered, doing all sorts of things during a time when a quarantine is recommended.\nBut oh no. Not for Oksanochka N\u00ebntori Hujati who wants to climb mountains, visit gardens, hop on public buses all the whilst recommending everyone else to stay inside as part of her plan to enjoy everything to herself. Well played, Oksanochka N\u00ebntori Hujati.\nPets and Corona Virus\nA friend by the name of Rosalina invited me over to the apartment she was at because she was looking after a dog for a couple who escaped the country under the pretext of a \u201choliday\u201d. I didn\u2019t need any convincing because the moment I heard the three-lettered word \u2018dog\u2019, was the moment I dashed to the subway ready to make my way over. I have quite a history with these furry fluff balls and my story would put whatever cheesy dog movie to shame anytime, anyday. I am just saying Marley & Me would\u2019ve been a bigger, wider hit rather than the snoozefest it is if I had been the scriptwriter. I am a hard core dog lover and not in a wanting-to-eat kind of way so, naturally, Rosalina\u2019s offer to come by her place and meet the dog was met with a resounding \u201cYes\u201d, on the basis I wanted to see the dog more than her.\nWe\u2019ll call the dog Rosalina was looking after the typical generic Fluffy . I naturally couldn\u2019t keep my hands off Fluffy and kept drunkenly petting it throughout the night. In some situations my touches became borderline homicidal, and the only reason I didn\u2019t end up killing it was due to how weak I was, but God knows if I \u201clifted\u201d and \u201cbenched\u201d, I would\u2019ve accidentally squeezed the life out of the little thing. Yes, I had oceans of love to offer Fluffy, but sadly, such love was short-lived.\nThe morning after, Rosalina and I went through the usual virus-proofing routine as we strapped on masks before taking beloved Fluffy out for a not-so-relaxing walk. Fluffy seemed like a very responsible dog as he would pee and poo everywhere but then go on to lick the city clean, as if it was his way of apologizing for defecating in some scenic spots earlier. But that was the problem with Fluffy. It was blissfully oblivious to the pandemic, unaware that it was no longer safe to lick everywhere in this virus infested city. Every time he would decide to sweep up some germs with his tongue, I would freeze in fear with eyes bulging out in disbelief. Not only that but this dog had a crazy bladder as he would pee every five seconds, making me think whether this was symptomatic of the corona virus in dogs.\nWhen we arrived home, the dog ran up to the sofa and rolled all over it as if it was marking it with it\u2019s scent, leading me to deem the sofa unsafe for human usage before I told Rosalina I could not stay and left immediately.\nYeah, yeah. So much for being a \u201chardcore dog lover\u201d but this story still beats Marley & Me. I was later assured that dogs and cats cannot get this Corona virus but I ain\u2019t risking it.\nI am sorry, Fluffy. \u2764\ufe0f\nFluffy isn\u2019t alone to being subjected to such cruel behaviour of abandonment (Yes, admittingly by myself). The word is that many disloyal owners are throwing out their pets as they are afraid of catching the corona virus from them, and this has resulted in an uptick in woofs and meows you would hear outside.\nRecently, me and my flatmates heard a series of meows outside our own flat. Panic ensued when I opened the door and there was cat in the corridor \u2013 it somehow made it to the 21 st floor because my flatmates reported seeing it on the ground floor not so long ago. I immediately took action and used an umbrella to poke it into the elevator and sent it back down, much to its dismay.\nLater, however, when I went outside to take my delivered food, the same cat was there and clung on to me with its potentially infected paws. In a necessary act of animal cruelty, I gently kicked it away but then when it came running back and touched my fucking feet, I was enraged and considered the idea of dropping it off a balcony to end its misery. Yes, the current panicky atmosphere in combination with my lack of respect for cats really led to some terribly dark thoughts. Luckily, I never acted upon that particular idea because an unsuspecting woman came by soon after and the cat, in a desperate attempt to be adopted, went into an elevator with her. Yes, this does seem like a beginning of a horror movie, doesn\u2019t it? Poor woman.\nAt the place of my internship, we also have a cat who is a mega-diva. There was a time when we wanted to take advantage of his cuteness and use him in a greeting card, but he just would not cooperate and threw tantrums left, right, and center before heading into his own automated smart-home. I do hope he stays safe and is not abandoned by our company because my god, that cat is not made for street life. The future ahead \u2013 or the lack of.\nAre you scared? I am. But not of death \u2013 I have reached a point in my life where I welcome death with open arms. But I am scared of dying in a Chinese hospital where there is a huge language barrier, and loved ones not being able to visit for a final goodbye. Death is nothing to worry about. It\u2019s the moments before.\nBut if you gotta go, you gotta go.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["That really happened in"], "gensraw_title": [[2505, 1108, 3023, 288]], "probs_title": [[0.0027230808045715094, 0.0019159340299665928, 0.12329821288585663, 0.09264396876096725]]}

But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the CDC, as you will read below. Which is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China. I am forced to ask and answer a few questions. During 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep. Like I said, something's not right, folks. I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear. The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in. There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies. China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China. There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus. Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government. Its not a conspiracy, its just tragedy. According to the June 27, 2012 research report followup three years later, it gets much more disturbing when you learn about the CDC's final estimate of the H1N1 virus global death toll. You and I find at this at this article at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy website, the CDC's 18,449 total deaths number was \"...regarded as WELL BELOW THE TRUE TOTAL, mainly because many people who die of flu-related causes are not tested for the disease.\" So during the 2009 outbreak, was anyone accusing the American medical and government authorities of hiding the numbers? Were Americans with hidden cameras strolling into the Mayo Clinic to PROVE how many people were really dying? The absurdity of these vicious attacks are that whether or not a person specifically does have the Corona virus or some other viral bug presenting as pneumonia, the treatment is the same supportive treatment anyway. Something's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice. Instead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. \"What about...\" reactions don't help. And here's the mic drop for you: \"The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections.\" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it? Was there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States? Did China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers? Today I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom. In 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No. Did the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No. Did Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no. Fascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions. I have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all? Let's test our ability to reason, to be rational: If you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach? If you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore? Would you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics. Finally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus: This Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes. The Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate. The Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old. China identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus. Its impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet. Like I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book. But I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family. My family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points. The xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut.

In addition to serious health outcomes, this has also led to social and economic upheaval in many countries, including mass job losses and nationwide shutdowns.\nExperience from previous coronavirus outbreaks \u2013 notably Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 \u2013 suggests that healthcare workers are at considerable risk of acquiring infection, particularly when involved in aerosol-generating critical care procedures. 2-4 This risk is even more pronounced with COVID-19, with daily reports of personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and fatalities of healthcare workers in other countries. 5\nIn Emergency Departments (EDs), the traditional approach of rushing to a critically ill patient\u2019s side to provide life-saving resuscitation must now be balanced with the risk of acquiring a potentially fatal illness. 6 7 This highlights an ethical tension between the duty to treat and a healthcare worker\u2019s right to protection. 8\nIn this context, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) has produced guidance for the management of adult cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era. Clinical guidelines on many aspects of the response to COVID-19 have been produced by a team of emergency physicians and College staff working in collaboration with Safer Care Victoria. 9\nThis paper describes the rationale for changing the approach to cardiac arrest. Our guidelines align with statements and guidance from national and international resuscitation bodies, including the Australian and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation, 10 the New Zealand Resuscitation Council, 11 the United Kingdom Resuscitation Council, 12 13 the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, 14 and the American Heart Association. 15 We have also aligned with other local guidelines on critical care in the context of COVID-19, including the Safe Airway Society 16 and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society. 17\nThese latter guidelines provide specific advice on airway management and tracheal intubation, therefore ACEM\u2019s guidance does not provide detailed information on this aspect of cardiac arrest management.\nSignificant changes include an overarching and deliberate emphasis on staff safety, while still providing the best possible care for patients requiring resuscitation. Important considerations include the need to balance the appropriateness of resuscitation against the risk of infection, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), recognition that in a setting of low community transmission most cardiac arrests are still not due to COVID-19, and that early defibrillation saves lives. Additionally, as COVID-19 increasingly affects hospital resource availability, the ethics of resource allocation must be considered.\nMost recommendations in this document are based on low certainty evidence. We have applied standard resuscitation principles, and substantially rely on expert opinion. Similar to other COVID-19 guidelines, as knowledge develops during the pandemic, recommendations may change, and these guidelines will need to be updated. However, at the time of writing, it is believed that these recommendations are safe and appropriate for use in pre-hospital and emergency care systems in the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIs resuscitation appropriate?\nEthical consideration of the appropriateness of resuscitation should balance the: Individuals\u2019 goals of care and requests for limitations on measures to prolong life. These should be clarified early for all those admitted to hospital or at risk of requiring hospital admission. This is a shared responsibility of community- and hospital-based clinicians. Likelihood that the patient will benefit from treatment/s Potential for such treatment/s to limit capacity to offer treatment to others with an imperative for fair resource allocation Potential of such treatments to cause harm, including harm to other patients (by diverting staff from attending to other patients who then deteriorate) and staff (through transmission of infection).\nA variety of resources are available to assist patients and clinicians in discussions regarding treatment limitations and end of life decisions. ACEM\u2019s broader clinical guidelines include specific recommendations for establishing treatment goals in the context of COVID-19. A summary of this approach is included in Figure 1 ( available in the PDF version ). 9 For patients for whom resuscitation is deemed inappropriate, palliative care pathways should be utilised to ensure appropriate and evidence-based care for dying patients.\nSystems to recognise clinical deterioration and prevent cardiorespiratory arrest due to progression of severe illness are also important, within the community, ED and in hospital.\nIn the event that resuscitation is required, a number of factors should be considered (Figure 2 \u2013 available in the PDF version ). These include: Are staff protected by appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)? Are there any documented goals of care / advance care directives? Is there an appropriate resuscitation setting (single or negative pressure room) available that limits risk to others? What is the chance of successful resuscitation with good neurological outcome? What is the risk to other patients in offering resuscitation?\nInfection control and aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) in the context of resuscitation\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is primarily transmitted through droplets. Droplet transmission occurs when infectious droplets contact the conjunctiva or mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract or the conjunctiva, either directly transmitted from a cough or sneeze, or by contact with a surface upon which droplets have deposited. The use of droplet and contact PPE (gown / apron, surgical mask, gloves and eye protection) reduces the risk of transmission, as it provides a physical barrier between the droplets and the portal of entry, 18 and is recommended in most settings for prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 19\nSARS-CoV-2 may cause airborne transmission if there is generation of aerosols during specific procedures such as intubation and non-invasive ventilation. These aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are hypothesized to result in an infectious aerosol beyond that which would normally be released by coughing, sneezing, or breathing. 20 This aerosol may remain suspended in the air for a period of time, and can be inhaled, leading to healthcare worker infection. Airborne and contact PPE (gown, N95 mask, gloves and eye protection) is recommended for health care workers conducting AGPs in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.\nDuring periods where there is sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no significant population immunity (either naturally or vaccine acquired) there will be times when it is reasonable to assume that in the first instance, all undifferentiated critically ill patients are infected with COVID-19.\nTable 1 ( available in the PDF version ) provides a summary of recommended PPE for various interventions and procedures associated with resuscitation. Some patients will have been assessed as low-risk for COVID-19 prior to deterioration, and not require droplet precautions for initial resuscitation steps. However, other patients will either be at high-risk for COVID-19, or their risk unable to be determined. In these cases, droplet precautions are recommended for healthcare workers providing the initial response.\nDefibrillation is not considered an AGP, with a recent ILCOR systematic review finding no evidence that defibrillation generates aerosols. 21 In general, all other resuscitative procedures are considered AGPs and therefore require airborne PPE. However, these recommendations are based on weak evidence, and further research may lead to changes in advice. We have taken a deliberately conservative approach, in line with various resuscitation organisations. 1 10-12 15 16 19\nAll staff attending a collapsed patient should be wearing appropriate PPE. The level of PPE dictates which interventions may be safely provided by healthcare workers. A staff member should be specifically assigned to ensure safe PPE use by all staff participating in resuscitation. Specific attention should be paid to mask fit for staff members wearing airborne PPE, and to supervise appropriate donning and doffing.\nTo further protect staff, it is recommended that senior oversight and expertise is used to minimise the number of people involved in a resuscitation. In-situ simulation may be helpful for ED staff to become familiar with the roles and practical challenges of a smaller resuscitation team.\nOptimal setting for resuscitation\nIt is recognised that cardiac arrests do not always occur in a convenient location. In hospital, a collapse may occur in a waiting room, bathroom, corridor, or a patient cubicle. Traditionally, resuscitation occurs in a large, open ED resuscitation cubicle.\nFrom an infection control perspective, a single negative pressure room is the safest location for aerosol-generating procedures (Figure 3 \u2013 available in the PDF version ), and the patient should be moved to one as soon as practicable. However, resuscitation should not be withheld if a single room is not immediately available.\nWhere there is no capacity to provide any type of single room (negative pressure room, single room with a door, or single room with a curtain) the most senior clinician should consider whether it is appropriate to initiate or continue resuscitation. In particular, they should consider whether the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers and other patients outweighs the possible benefit to the individual patient. In a setting where patients who are positive for COVID-19 are cohorted in an open ward, and all staff are wearing appropriate PPE, this consideration is less relevant.\nHow should the management of cardiac arrest change?\nIn view of the above considerations, a number of modifications to existing advanced life support protocols should be made. These will now be discussed, in the context of the \u201cDRSABC\u201d (Danger, Response, Send for help, Airway, Breathing, Circulation) approach. It should be emphasized that all standard resuscitation interventions are still appropriate, however, need to be performed by staff wearing adequate PPE.\nDanger\nIdeally, all resuscitation should be performed by healthcare workers in PPE suitable for AGPs. However, it is recognised that this may not be the case for first responders.\nFirst responders should be wearing at least a surgical mask, eye protection and gloves. If the patient is high-risk for COVID-19 or unable to be assessed, first responders should be wearing droplet PPE. The patient\u2019s mouth and nose should be covered by an oxygen mask (if available) with flow of up to 10 L/minute. Additional protection against droplet/spray contamination is recommended, and can be achieved by covering the mask with a towel, cloth, surgical mask or clear plastic sheet. 11\nDefibrillation is not considered an AGP and can be performed by first responders, as long as the patient\u2019s mouth and nose are covered.\nEnsure that any oxygen source is turned off (but oxygen mask and other covering left on patient) prior to defibrillation attempts.\nChest compressions, assisted ventilation, and advanced airway manoeuvres are all considered potentially AGPs, and should only be performed by responders in airborne PPE and in an appropriate space. It is reasonable for compression-only CPR to commence outside and en route to a single room (i.e. in a corridor, waiting room, etc), provided that responders are wearing airborne PPE, and the patient\u2019s mouth and nose are covered as outlined above.\nResponse and Send for help\nIf the patient is unresponsive and not breathing normally, then resuscitation may be necessary. Call for help. Ensure that all clinicians are wearing appropriate PPE.\nAirway and Breathing\nListening or feeling for breathing should not occur. Instead, place a hand on patient\u2019s chest to feel for chest rise and fall while assessing for normal breathing.\nPlace a standard oxygen mask (e.g. Hudson mask) on the patient and open their airway with a head tilt / chin lift. Do not attempt to clear the airway using any other methods. Suctioning of the orophanynx should not occur through an open suction device (i.e. Yankauer sucker) until in an appropriate location with staff using airborne PPE.\nProvide passive oxygen at a flow rate of 10 L/minute.\nDo not provide positive pressure ventilation until in an appropriate physical location and wearing airborne PPE. An appropriate heat and moisture exchanging (HME) viral filter must be connected to any positive pressure oxygen delivery device, as close to the patient as possible. Consider adding a closed in-line suction system (Figure 3 \u2013 available in the PDF version ). Take care to ensure that all connections are secure and consider the use of reinforcing tape.\nBag-mask ventilation should be minimised. If required, use two hands to hold the mask. Compressions should be paused, and the bag should be squeezed by a second rescuer at a compression:ventilation ratio of 30:2. 21 A supraglottic airway device is preferred to a face mask, as it is thought to reduce the risk of aerosols. 16\nPause compressions before inserting a supraglottic airway or attempting to intubate.\nIf additional oxygen delivery is required, a well-fitted supraglottic airway device (e.g. an i-gel) should be inserted and connected via an appropriate filter to a Mapleson circuit (\u201canaesthetic bag\u201d) or a standard self-inflating bag.\nA Mapleson circuit is preferred due to the ability to provide passive oxygen flow without the need to provide positive pressure ventilation. If using a Mapleson circuit, connect the circuit to oxygen, but do not squeeze the bag.\nIf using a standard self-inflating bag, monitor the movement of the reservoir bag. If oxygen is being delivered, then do not squeeze the bag. However, in the absence of respiratory effort, oxygen may not be delivered due to the valve mechanism of a standard self-inflating bag, and gentle squeezing of the bag may be required.\nIf possible, positive pressure ventilation should only be delivered once an endotracheal tube has been inserted in the trachea, the cuff has been inflated, an HME viral filter connected, and correct placement confirmed.\nSuctioning through an endotracheal tube should occur through a closed inline system, in the highest level of isolation available, and by a healthcare worker in airborne PPE.\nCirculation\nRapid rhythm assessment and defibrillation should be prioritised.\nUntil endotracheal intubation has occurred, compression-only CPR is recommended. However, if positive pressure ventilation is required, then compressions should be paused to allow ventilation while using a mask or supraglottic airway. 12\nMechanical CPR devices should be used when available and staff are adequately trained in their use. They may be useful to reduce the number of healthcare workers present during resuscitation.\nModified resuscitation algorithm\nAn algorithm for adult advanced life support is presented (Figure 4 \u2013 available in the PDF version ). This is an adaptation of the New Zealand Resuscitation Council algorithm, with modification of the terminology for PPE. An approach to the initial steps of resuscitation is presented in Figure 5 ( available in the PDF version ).\nMonitoring of resuscitation\nApart from minimising the number of people in the room, resuscitation should occur according to established protocols. Waveform capnography should be used. Focused cardiac ultrasound may be useful to guide resuscitation efforts, and / or demonstrate absence of cardiac activity and early cessation of resuscitation.\nAdvanced resuscitation techniques\nAdvanced resuscitation techniques such as extracorporeal life support should be carefully considered and only used in exceptional circumstances for currently accepted indications (e.g. massive pulmonary embolism, or specific toxicologic emergencies). Provision of such interventions should include assessment of the potential benefit to the patient, resources required, and the potential associated diversion of resources from others for delivery of such treatments.\nIn the setting of a cardiac arrest in the ED from presumed COVID-19, escalation to extracorporeal life support is not currently recommended, due to a high likelihood of futility.\nPost-resuscitation care\nIf return of spontaneous circulation is achieved prior to intubation, then time should be taken to assess need for and potential benefit of intubation in the context of the individual\u2019s goals of care.\nIf requiring mechanical ventilation, clamp the endotracheal tube before disconnecting from the patient. Ensure a closed inline suction system is connected.\nAt the end of resuscitation attempts, everyone should remove PPE carefully, and thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser). It is recommended that staff observe each other while removing PPE to monitor for possible breaches in infection control procedures.\nEquipment should be cleaned, disinfected or disposed of according to hospital protocols.\nFollowing resuscitation, it is important to conduct a debrief with team members, to specifically address clinical care and decision-making, communication, PPE and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Additional support may be required due to the risk to staff, altered decision-making framework, lack of physical proximity of the patient\u2019s family members and significant mortality rate of COVID-19. Any breaches of PPE policy should be documented and reported and followed up according to local protocols.\nA log of all staff attending the resuscitation should be maintained to facilitate appropriate infection control follow-up if needed.\nTermination of resuscitation\nCardiac arrests will still occur due to all of the \u201cusual\u201d causes such as acute coronary syndromes, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, anaphylaxis, drug toxicity, and neurological events. Decisions regarding resuscitation termination should be made according to currently accepted standards.\nA cardiac arrest in a patient with COVID-19 infection and respiratory failure should prompt rapid assessment and treatment of potentially reversible causes. If no such cause is identified, clinicians should give early consideration to futility of ongoing resuscitation. 22\nCare for family members\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, family members are likely to be restricted from entering resuscitation rooms, apart from in exceptional circumstances (for example paediatric cardiac arrest). If resuscitation is unsuccessful, family members may \u2013 according to local hospital policies and infection control measures - be allowed to view the body. However, restrictions in place due to COVID-19 may significantly disrupt usual grieving processes \u2013 for example, not being allowed to touch or kiss the deceased. 23 If required, social work support should be provided to family members in a safe location or via telehealth where COVID-19 precludes visitation. Bereavement procedures can otherwise follow local hospital guidelines. Appropriate PPE should be used by staff when preparing the body for the mortuary.\nTraining and simulation\nThe changes outlined in this document require a significant adaptation for many doctors, nurses and paramedics. It is critically important that all healthcare workers have regular PPE and advanced life support training, are able to access in-situ simulation sessions, and receive extensive debriefing after actual resuscitations. This will ensure safe, timely and effective management of the arrested patient in the COVID-19 era.\nConclusion\nAlthough infection risks posed by COVID-19 influence all aspects of adult cardiac arrest management, the basic principles of resuscitation remain the same. Modifications to traditional approaches include a much greater emphasis on safety of healthcare workers and use of adequate personal protective equipment. However, prioritisation of rapid defibrillation and attention to reversible causes of cardiac arrest remain critical interventions to improve patient outcomes.

Source\uff1aGlobal Times On February 4, 2020, in a community in Nanfeng Street, Xianju County, Zhejiang Province, volunteers are using small speakers to publicize epidemic prevention knowledge. (Photo by Wang Huabin from People\u2019s Daily Online) The fatality rate of confirmed novel coronavirus-related pneumonia cases in China was 2.1 percent as of Monday night, February 3, far below previous international outbreaks of H1N1 flu, MERS and Ebola viruses, Chinese officials said. The death rate for this novel coronavirus epidemic is around 2.1 percent in China, much lower than other epidemics, and since Saturday, we have seen more people recovering from the disease than dying from it, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks on Tuesday\u2019s online media briefing. The death rate from the 2009 H1N1 flu in the US was 17.4 percent, and the 2012 MERS death rate was 34.4 percent, while the number for Ebola was 40.4 percent. However, the fatality rate of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan was 4.9 percent, significantly higher than the national rate of 2.1 percent, the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said at a press conference on Tuesday, explaining that the gap was due to the fact that Wuhan's early treatment capacity was way below demand. There were only three designated hospitals to treat severe novel coronavirus-related pneumonia patients in Wuhan at the early stages, with only 110 beds which were far from enough, said Jiao Yahui, an official with the NHC. Apart from the designated hospitals, patients infected with novel coronavirus were distributed in more than 20 medical institutions across the city, lacking unified management and efficient distribution of high-quality medical resources, causing a relatively high fatality rate, Jiao said. The shortage of medical supplies in the fight against the novel coronavirus is still very prominent at the frontline, especially the shortage of medical protective suits and N95 masks, the commission confirmed. The number of medical personnel dispatched to Wuhan in efforts to combat the outbreak is expected to reach 10,000 in total by Wednesday, Jiao said. A total of 15,000 fever clinics and 2,092 designated hospitals were set up across the mainland to fight the epidemic, meeting basic needs of patients, except for Hubei, center of the epidemic. More than 3,000 medical staff from major hospitals in a dozen of provinces will be dispatched to take over the newly designated inpatient wards in Wuhan that receive critical patients suffering from the virus, Jiao said.

See how Wuhan is located right in the center of China\u2019s highly productive southeast region\u2014the economic powerhouse of the nation. This strategic location was selected for the biological attack because of the easily engineered vectors of disease dissemination as depicted by the map above. Paralyzing China\u2019s economic and financial sectors is, after all, a primary goal of this essentially Anglo-American black operation. See: Why the coronavirus is a real threat to China\u2019s economy In light of the US-staged Hong Kong protests, U.S. tariff regime against China, threat of economic sanctions against nations working with Huawei, CIA-inflamed Xinjiang conflict involving the Muslim Uyghurs, provocative sailing of US Navy warships through the Taiwan Strait, transparent political prosecution of Huawei\u2019s CFO, ravaging of China\u2019s pig farms by a bioengineered virus, etc., the Chinese government has been under withering attack since 2018. When so many debilitating assaults are suspiciously happening at once, what can China do except deal with them in a manner so as to expose the true culprits. However, China is not likely to do that in the case of this intensifying bio-war being waged by the West. SARS conspiracy theory The original SARS pandemic that took place in China after the turn of the millennium was also well-known in bio-medical circles as a naked act of biowarfare. Like this year\u2019s coronavirus bio-attack in Wuhan, the bioengineered SARS outbreak also involved a highly coordinated campaign of propaganda and disinformation. See: Is the new \u2018deadly China virus\u2019 a covert operation? However, the administration of Xi Jinping is much too concerned about the panic that would inevitably result if the populace was informed of a full-blown bioweapon attack. The precipitating chaos would simply overwhelm the government in Beijing which is already on serious overload because of the endless interference by the Anglo-American Axis. The SARS outbreak that occurred from 2002 to 2003 has already shown that China is not willing to release the hard scientific evidence that proves the premeditated release of a bioengineered coronavirus. The following excerpt from Wikipedia explains some of the background of SARS\u2014the Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that took place primarily in mainland China and Hong Kong, but also in Canada and other countries. Excerpt from SARS conspiracy theory Wuhan Coronavirus of 2020 The rapidly spreading Wuhan coronavirus, also known as Novel coronavirus, that was first reported in 2019 has all the hallmarks of yet another bioengineered virus in a U.S. Military laboratory. What follows is a short description form Wikipedia of this Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Time will tell whether this deadly coronavirus was released into the Chinese population with the intent to kill and sicken, scare and intimidate. The intimidation phase of such an ongoing black operation is certainly aimed at the government in Beijing which refuses to be coerced and threatened by the Trump administration. Because the highly disruptive, Western-backed Hong Kong protests have yet to yield the result desired by the U.S. State Department, it was only a matter of time before the C.I.A. implemented Plan B\u2026or is this Plan C or D? KEY POINT: The replication process (see diagram above) of this particular coronavirus, and how quickly it mutates and/or adapts to various pharmaceutical treatment regimens, will reveal exactly how this pathogenic microorganism was bioengineered. Why China? The $64,000 question here is: Why is China always the epicenter for so many strains and variations of coronaviruses, influenzas, pneumonia viruses and other highly contagious infection agents that strike the major commercial centers on southeastern mainland. What\u2019s particularly suspicious about all of these outbreaks in China is that they are each described by the Mainstream Media (MSM) as quite dangerous to human health. The mortality rate in the beginning of these eventual pandemics is especially high, as if by purposeful design of the bioengineers. In this way, the whole world is eventually drawn into a pandemic melodrama that\u2019s certainly designed to fear-monger. Hence, more of these endless distractions serve the specific purpose of taking the attention away from real problems caused by governments everywhere. But it\u2019s the numerous criminal conspiracies at work and shocking scandals that the elites seek to cover up by any means possible. You know it\u2019s a distraction when Drudge hypes it like this. There are relatively few military bioweaponry labs in the world that have the capability to create such a fatal and infectious virus. Thus, when the truth is confirmed about the Wuhan flu, there will be only a few culprits who are behind these assaults against the Chinese people. In reality, should this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak become a full-blown epidemic in China it could represent an attempt to commit genocide. Likewise, if it becomes a bona fide pandemic, it could ultimately be labeled a crime against humanity, perhaps even genocide. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation It\u2019s of paramount importance to understand that there really is a vast and highly organized New World Order conspiracy to foist a One World Government on the world community of nations. See: Is this Bill Gates\u2019 long-awaited excuse to usher in global governance? There are several main pillars of this New World Order agenda, one of which is being stealthily put into place by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Likewise, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are slowly erecting one of the primary social media pillars as is Tony Dorsey at Twitter and Susan Wojcicki at YouTube. Bill and Hillary Clinton are using the Clinton Foundation to take advantage of poor countries around the world while surreptitiously laying the foundation for future exploitation on a mass scale just as George Soros & Sons are deceitfully creating new societies via geoengineered climate change, multiculturalism and cultural marxism. The crucial point is that all of these high-paid globalists are intimately connected to each other and covertly working to advance the same nation-destroying U.N. agendas. See: PEDOGATE : Epstein cofounded Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Gates hung out with Epstein AFTER conviction Fabricating global crises is at the very core of these various NWO sub-agendas. Two of the \u2018scariest\u2019 manufactured catastrophes are those that severely impact the biosphere (e.g. global warming) and undermine human health (e.g. deadly pandemics). In this way, false pretexts are being cunningly constructed to justify the establishment of an all-powerful One World Government . Toward that end, the NWO globalist cabal knows that they must first sufficiently manufacture consent so that the people demand a totalitarian form of global governance to manage these public health disasters and environmental catastrophes. Multi-billionaires such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros were all given their fortunes mostly through exorbitant corporate compensation plans, insider trading, currency manipulations, off-shore tax evasion schemes, and other forms of criminal unconscionable enrichment. Once they received those ill-gotten gains, they were completely own by the International Banking Cartel (IBC). The IBC then directs the expenditures of every single dollar given to these made tycoons, most of which are allocated toward carrying out the NWO implementation plan. The pet projects listed on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website are examples of that nefarious plan. Of course, the whole world now knows that their pet project is their worldwide Super-Vaccination Agenda , where every single person is vaccinated every year, on time, and micro-chipped accordingly. What better way to completely control the global populace? See: India To Prosecute Bill Gates For Using Tribal Children To Conduct Illegal Vaccine Test There is no better way to enforce a mandatory global vaccination schedule than to engineer a frightening pandemic with an exceedingly high mortality rate. Billions of people will then demand the newly formulated vaccine necessary to protect them from such a fatal infection and/or debilitating disease. Hence, before anyone receives such a vaccine, it\u2019s important to know that the process REQUIRED to produce such an effective immunization is literally years from the making, if one is possible at all because of how intricately this coronavirus was bio-engineered to elude proper analysis and necessary experimentation. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite easy for any of the numerous U.S. military bioweapon labs to bioengineer a deadly super-virus and then release it in a city as large as Wuhan, China. Acts of bioterrorism like this are carried out all the time. As a matter of historical fact, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 actually originated at Fort Riley, Kansas where soldiers reported to the Army\u2019s largest training facility during World War I. The soldiers who were [DELIBERATELY] infected with the H1N1 influenza virus then served as countless vectors of dissemination for the pandemic that ultimately killed as many as 100 million people worldwide. That single US-executed biowarfare operation against humanity was arguably the deadliest depopulation event in human history.\u201d (See: Spanish Flu of 1918 Was Really a Bioterror Attack on Humanity ) \u2014 Intelligence Analyst & Former U.S. Army Officer Conclusion There\u2019s no better way to compel a populace to comply with draconian vaccination regimens than to scare them with the prospect of a deadly pandemic. Governments around the world are constantly under pressure from the New World Order globalist cabal to implement the Super-Vaccination Agenda . Toward that end, the world community of nations has been repeatedly victimized by manufactured measles outbreaks and ever-worsening flu seasons, so they tell us. See: Annual Flu Shot Programs and Staged Measles Outbreaks Are the Central Pillars of the Super-Vaccination Agenda However, there really is much more to this story than meets the eye. Not only was the Wuhan coronavirus surreptitiously disseminated to serve as a major distraction from a rapidly collapsing Global Economic & Financial System , this state-sponsored black operation also represents the worst of predatory capitalism conducted as a means of generating revenue. Much more significantly, this staged pandemic will be cunningly used to exert oppressive international controls on travel as well as impose draconian medical measures which greatly advance the Super-Vaccination Agenda . Lastly, the timing of the deadly virus that ravaged China\u2019s pig farms last year quite predictably triggered a call for the development of a preventative vaccine. What the following news report neglected to state was that the mass slaughter of pigs, in a society that demands LOTS of pork, was cynically planned to manufacture the urgent need for yet another vaccine. See: China\u2019s Pig Farms Decimated by Virus\u2014Was it bioengineered and spread on purpose? The bottom line here is that the Wuhan coronavirus is likely another race-targeting bioweapon strategically unleashed throughout China by U.S. military labs Special Note: People, everything points to this bio-terror attack being the BIG ONE (also known as the global depopulation event we\u2019ve all been waiting for). This coronavirus is moving around the globe so fast, and being hyped by the Mainstream Media with such a vengeance, it\u2019s as though this will be their primary tool for total global lockdown. If the infection rate continues to proliferate into a full-blown pandemic, like The Powers That Be did with the Spanish flu, then this really is the depopulation event many of us have warned about. This highly misguided and naked act of bio-terrorism could even evolve into an ELE, God forbid. There\u2019s no question that 2020 promises to be a year of pervasive and profound transformation. The current state of affairs throughout the world community of nations cannot continue; it\u2019s far too unstable and explosive. Hence, it\u2019s quite likely that there will be a series of global catalysts that will prompt the necessary changes. While some of these apocalyptic calamities may seem terrifying at first, ultimately they will serve to contribute to the ongoing planetary catharsis. Whereas many folks will see all of these End-time crises as being intentionally manufactured by the power elite to save their own skins, REMEMBER, even the Dark Side can only act as the Highest Power permits. Also, that, ultimately, \u201call things work together toward good\u201d . State of the Nation\nJanuary 20, 2020 Recommended Reading SUPER-VACCINATION AGENDA Being Foisted On The USA 24/7 Update 1 After seeing their whole country burned down by Operation Torch Australia , how could the Australian government possibly refuse globalist orders to develop a coronavirus vaccine. (See: Always obeying their NWO globalist masters, Australia swiftly develops coronavirus vaccine! ) As it was previously stated, the typical Hegelian Dialectic Problem~Reaction~Solution strategy will now be used to foist a toxic vaccination regimen on the entire planetary civilization. Update 2 The NWO globalist cabal knows that fastidiously bioengineered viruses, especially those which are hardwired to rapidly morph and mutate so as to elude an effective remedy, are the most effective depopulation weapons in their arsenal. See: The bioengineered Spanish flu that killed upwards of 100 MILLION people originated at Fort Riley, Kansas Update 3 Even popular Alt Media platforms are being used to float planted propaganda and false narratives \u2014 PREEMPTIVELY \u2014 in order to deflect any and all attention from this transparent bio-terror attack by the West. See this purposeful headline, which is usually issued by the CIA\u2019s Mockingbird Media , as an example of such a diversionary tactic and strategic misdirection: The Real Umbrella Corp: Wuhan Ultra Biohazard Lab Was Studying \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Dangerous Pathogens\u201d . Update 4 Fear-mongering headlines about China such as this one will only intensify until President Xi Jinping bends to the will of the Trump administration regarding the \u201ctrade deal from hell\u201d : China On Edge Of Chaos: \u201c7 Cities, 23 Million People Under Quarantine\u201d . Oh, and by the way, the headlines now read like this today: \u201cBeijing Calls In Military As Virus Overwhelms Wuhan Hospitals\u201d. Who, pray tell, will travel to China in 2020 in view of these swiftly deteriorating conditions?! Who will want to do business there? Exactly\u2014NO ONE. Which is exactly what the real perps wanted to achieve. Update 5 Will the utter panic being fueled by social media in China be used as a pretext to shut down vast swaths of the Internet? Both Big Tech and Big Social Media have been frenetically looking for ways to terminate the Alt Media . Here\u2019s what the ever-prevaricating New York Times featured today: Panic and Criticism Spread on Chinese Social Media Over Coronavirus . We\u2019re not saying it didn\u2019t happen; only that the Mainstream Media will do whatever is necessary to destroy the emerging Fifth Estate . See: Fifth Estate Looms Larger Than Ever as Alt Media Exposes NWO Agenda and Deep State Treason Update 6 There\u2019s an extremely malevolent aspect to this bio-terror operation: WEAPONIZED CORONAVIRUS : \u201cBioengineered as a self-replicating weapon system\u201d Update 7 Why didn\u2019t the U.S. implement the same type of border screenings as Russia and India? (See: Deadly Chinese coronavirus arrives in US as Russia, India & others boost border screenings ) The southern border, especially in California, is so porous and vulnerable to illegal aliens with deadly contagious diseases crossing over that any enemy could send infected Trojan horses into the Southwest all day long. Update 8 The United States Government is already notorious for recklessly releasing dangerous infection agents and contagious viruses into the national environment, as well as in foreign countries. One of the worst of these bio-terror operations unleashed in the 50 states concerns the multi-decade epidemic known as Lyme disease . For the unaware, the following video expos\u00e9 spells it out in graphic detail: The Officially Ignored Link Between Bioengineered Lyme Disease and the Plum Island Bioweapon Laboratory Update 9 As suspected, the NWO perps are taking this bioengineered pandemic global very, VERY quickly. The United States now has 3 confirmed cases and 63 suspected ones.

While there may be aspects and details that are proven to be fake, that does not mean the entire psyop / black op is a hoax. As the perps often do, they blend grim realities with obvious falsehoods in order to confuse investigative journalists who then promote their own fictitious narrative. This tendency must be resisted until we see how this factually evolves. See: It\u2019s way too early for the Alt Media to call this developing pandemic a hoax . Update 13 And along comes a PhD Toxicologist who really knows what he\u2019s talking about regarding this particular coronavirus. Despite a degree from Duke University\u2019s Department of Pathology, this trained scientist has left the reservation of political correctness and breaks it all down in this informative video: Coronavirus Is Worse Than You\u2019ve Been Told . Update 14 Every bioengineered pandemic, especially those that have gone unidentified and/or unacknowledged, have a specific purpose for the targeted populations and bloodlines. Whereas the Spanish flu was as a full-scale depopulation event, the Epstein-Barr virus released during the 1960s was a stealthy bio-terror attack with a highly hidden agenda. The rebellious Beatniks and Baby Boomers were the explicit target of the EBV stealth virus as their health has greatly suffered since those original bouts of Mononucleosis. Likewise, everything now points to the great likelihood that the present act of bio-terrorism in China was conducted to expose as many people as possible in order to degrade the overall health profiles and undermine the immune systems of the susceptible populations. This is why the Chinese bloodlines were specifically targeted; they have been set up to suffer a similar fate as those who still suffer from EBV Stage IV some 50 years after that bio-crime. This analysis certainly does not preclude the distinct possibility that the Wuhan bio-attack could end up morphing into a major depop event. Only time will tell. Update 15 An essential revisiting of the Spanish flu genocide reveals that it was the prescribed aspirin which turned that influenza into such a mass killer. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative that every person who contracts Wuhan coronavirus understands their treatment plan and is not taking any medicine(s) that can worsen it. Certain drug interactions, in particular, can significantly increase the severity of certain types of flu and their various symptoms. See: BEWARE: Spanish Flu Mortality Rate Soared Because of Doctor-prescribed Medicines Especially Aspirin Update 16 \u2018The Father of the Coronavirus Virus is the CDC\u2019, Brought to China by the C.I.A. Update 17 What\u2019s vital to correctly comprehend throughout this unfolding global drama is that there are multiple scenarios developing in different parts of the world as various covert schemes are being executed by the perpetrators. None of these scenarios are necessarily mutually exclusive. While some of them described in these updates may even appear to contradict each other, they can all be true and/or operative at the same time. For instance, it has been reported that Man Who Pushed SARS Dud Now Pushing New Chinese Virus . That factoid might lead many to believe that the current outbreak is a media-generated hoax, when in reality it could be much worse than what is represented by the MSM. In other words, this complex conspiracy was made quite complicated and confusing on purpose to confound both medical researchers and scientific investigators alike. Update 18 What makes Wuhan coronavirus so challenging to closely monitor and potentially decimating is this: Coronavirus Stealth Strain Bioengineered to Avoid Detection in Carriers Who Present No Symptoms The U.S. military labs have been hard at work over decades perfecting their newfangled bioweapons. What that means is that a previous pandemic \u2014 known or silent \u2014 is craftily utilized to lay the foundation for a future one that, when overlaid, triggers a whole new multi-infection syndrome which is both deadly and difficult to identify, much less treat successfully. There are also multiple chemtrail aerosol formulations that are used to activate different flu pathogens that line the respiratory tract. That\u2019s why so many now complain of both Chemtrail Flu and Chemtrail Syndrome . See: CHEMTRAIL SYNDROME: A Global Pandemic Of Epic Proportions Update 19 Now we know: Why are these 80 scientists now dead? And, why are they all microbiologists? Special Message from The Health Coach To: Any individual who wishes to guard against exposure to, or remediating symptoms caused by, the Wuhan coronavirus. The Health Coach has provided coaching and consultation services for clients with the flu, pneumonia, bronchitis, COPD, asthma, emphysema, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, as well as the whole range of both upper and lower respiratory infections and diseases. Every flu season brings its own unique set of symptoms and challenges which are met as quickly and successfully as possible with our highly individualized protocols. Our experience with SARS, MERS and other contagious coronavirus infections has well prepared us to assist our clients who have been infected or are vulnerable to infection. Our primary approach is holistic and preventative, natural and alternative. However, when medical interventions is necessary we are quick to refer and recommend the best specialists. A strong immune system and healthy body are the best guarantee against manifesting symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus\u20142019-nCoV. Because this strain is \u201cat least 70 percent similar in genome sequence to SARS-CoV\u201d , much of what we learned about SARS as far as treatment is concerned will be applicable. However, new approaches will also be necessary which The Health Coach is prepared to share on a case by case basis depending on the presenting symptoms and the individual\u2019s established body types.

Yep, I\u2019d agree with that, but thus far Bali, where we\u2019re staying, has reported no cases, suspected or confirmed.\nThat might change, especially as a couple of nights ago a guy in the next room exploded into a coughing and sneezing fit on his balcony. We immediately went into calculation mode. How far does a sneeze reach? Would the potentially noxious vapours reach our balcony? How long do they hang around in the air before subsiding to the vegetation below? Would the towels we hung out to dry be impregnated? What about the furniture?\nIt\u2019s probably relevant \u2013 at the risk of being accused of racism \u2013 to point out that the guy in question \u201clooked Chinese\u201d. So here\u2019s a question. Someone who \u201clooks Chinese\u201d starts sneezing violently within metres of your space. Do you speak to him to express concern? Do you speak to the hotel to let them know that one of their guests is displaying alarming symptoms, of what you know not? Or do you do nothing, because you don\u2019t want to appear racist?\nWe chose option 2. I felt like a snitch \u2013 a bit like one of those informers in authoritarian countries who turn in their neighbours for some imaginary offence. But in a country desperate to keep the coronavirus at bay, respiratory problems are not an offence. They\u2019re a potential health hazard.\nTo their credit, the hotel did take action. They spoke to him and asked him to wear a face mask. They offered to move us to another room, which we have not yet decided to do. It turns out that the person in question is indeed Chinese. He is apparently a Hong Kong resident. He speaks no English, so the hotel is bringing an interpreter to speak to him in some detail. So if I\u2019d spoken to him, it would have been in sign language, which might have resulted in unintended offence.\nWas I racist in suspecting that the person was from China? You decide.\nYesterday my wife and I had cause for a different concern. I was sitting on the balcony and she was inside on the bed. Suddenly my armchair appeared to be moving from side to side. Thinking my eustachian tubes were having an off day, I didn\u2019t stand up screaming in panic. But then my wife called out to tell me that the bed was moving. Only slightly, but noticeably. Oh shit, we thought. Earthquake! Worse still, tsunami.\nBali is in an earthquake zone, so such an event was not impossible. But nobody else was running around in a panic, no masonry was flying around, so we assumed that we\u2019d felt a minor tremor. We were also comforted by the fact that the area outside our room was a designated tsunami assembly area.\nIt turns out that there was an earthquake yesterday in Indonesia, though some was away from Bali, in Southern Sumatra. The magnitude was 4.9, which isn\u2019t particularly serious. According to a website called earthquaketrack , there have been ten earthquakes of a similar strength across Indonesia over the past nine days, and three in the past twenty-four hours.\nSo is Mother Earth gearing up for a big one? Oh well, at least it would be a distraction from the bloody coronavirus. If the virus doesn\u2019t get you, the earthquake will. Time for the British stiff upper lip, and a survey of the room to find the best place to shelter. Under the mattress, most likely.\nWe\u2019re also keeping a close eye on events in Thailand. We\u2019re due in Phuket in ten days\u2019 time. So far, no coronavirus cases have been confirmed on the island. The Bangkok Post reports that 70% of the Chinese people who normally visit at this time of year are absent. Ten days is more than enough time for new cases to become obvious, so if it turns out that Phuket is falling victim to a substantial outbreak, we\u2019ll consider our options.\nIf things start getting interesting here, I\u2019ve half a mind to ask a friend, who lives nearby and is a spiritual healer, about whom I wrote a year ago , whether he can summon the spirits to provide us some immunity. Just a thought, although yesterday there was a mass prayer event in Kuta, presumably intended to have the same effect. When in Bali do as the Balinese.\nOur Chinese neighbour has been moved to another room, away from neighbours. I hope he\u2019s okay, obviously for more reasons than self-preservation.

But timing is critical. A single mention on the evening news and this opportunity could get away from you. Moderna Surges On Corona Virus Outbreak, Is Now The Time To Buy? Posted on Wednesday, January 22nd, 2020 by Thomas Hughes Share by Email Moderna Inc, Is A Likely Player To Develop Vaccines For Wuhan Virus\nShares of Moderna Inc ( MNRA ) surged more than 6% in premarket trading and may be headed higher. The move is driven by a growing belief it will be a major player in the development of vaccines for China\u2019s latest viral outbreak. The disease, a form of coronavirus, has already claimed the lives of nine people in China and more deaths are expected.\nThe first case of the new coronavirus has been found in the U.S. already. The victim, a male traveler from China, was found in Snohomish County, Washington and is now in isolation. Moderna is already working on vaccines for a number of commonly found illnesses so it makes sense they would tackle this one as well. Vaccines in the pipeline include those for CMV, RSV, hMPV, Zika, and H7N9 flu.\nLabeled the Wuhan Coronavirus, symptoms for most are similar to a heavy cold or onset of pneumonia. So far, more than 400 cases have been diagnosed in China. The disease is highly contagious which makes it of particular concern this week. The Chinese Lunar New Year celebration will begin this weekend, 100\u2019s of millions of people are expected to travel.\nThe CDC is already screening travelers at airports in California and New York. They will be expanding their screens to airports in Chicago, Atlanta and other airports with traffic coming from Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization will convene a panel soon to discuss making the Wuhan Virus a global health emergency. Along with the risk to world health, world leaders are thinking back to the SARS virus and its impact on the global economy.\nModerna Inc, At The Cutting Edge Of Today's Medicines\nModerna Inc is a clinical-stage biotechnology company . Clinical-stage means its vaccines and pipeline of drugs is ready to be or in the process of being tested on humans. It develops therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, and rare diseases based on messenger RNA.\nmRNA therapies are highly-advanced, cutting edge technologies that threaten to upturn the entire drug industry . They use the body as a drug-making machine, the mRNA is the means by which they do it. The mRNA delivers messages directly to cells telling them to produce complex proteins that cost millions to make in a factory.\nThe hurdle for Moderna, and others in the gene-therapy field, is that introducing the new mRNA into the body triggers an automatic response. The response includes shutting down protein production and effectively blocking any positive effects the mRNA may have. On top of that, there is concern that if the mRNA can be delivered and not trigger a negative response, it may not be able to make enough new proteins to matter.\nThe CEO Is Bullish, Clinical Trials Advance\nEven so, there is a lot of work being done. Moderna has 11 drugs in clinical trials right now and 20 development projects in the pipeline. The company has collaborative deals with top-players like Astrazenaca ( AZN ), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Merck & Co ( MRK ), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nShares of Moderna got a boost a week or so ago after the company\u2019s CEO appeared on Mad Money. Bottom line, CEO Stephane Bancel is bullish on Moderna\u2019s prospects pointing out a-key drug is moving into the Phase III stage of trials. What this means is the company has proven its therapies can work, in this case for CMV (a common cold that can kill infants and elderly), now it has to prove they work better than today\u2019s standards.\nThe Technical Outlook Is Bullish For This Risky Stock\nThe technical outlook is bullish. Today\u2019s move began even before the outbreak of the Wuhan Virus and sets a new high. Sparked by the companies pipeline and outlook, this rally could have legs . The indicators support the breakout and suggest there is room for price action to run. The best targets for resistance are at the $24 and $29 levels, advances of 6% and 30% respectively.\nTraders looking to get into this move are cautioned, Moderna is a high-risk growth stock so be extra cautious with position size. Also, price action will probably pull-back to support or consolidate in sideways action before moving higher so there is no need to rush in or chase prices. Patience will pay off.

Today I took two new ones, one up and over the mountains on the backside of Tama instead of the one paved road in. On my way out I took the road past the airport, that winds around past the wetlands.\nBoth were wonderful. I got to see houses for sale here and there, found where the chocolate tour is and drove through some of the prettiest farmlands I've seen in ages. The road back behind the airport was glorious. Not paved but smoothly graded surrounded by wide open fields filled with cattle. Didn't have to ford any rivers or deal with traffic in and out of town.\nHad to go to town to pick up a cut rate Swiffer-knock off. My old one finally broke. No mopping Swiffer like things, so I'll have to pick one up tomorrow in Liberia when we pick up our friend. Instead I got treated to the stupidest reaction of all time to my Vog mask.\nPulled into the back parking lot for the only really luxurious shopping area in Tama, and saw some rather fluffy older what looked like American tourists standing near the mall entrance. All three were furiously puffing away in their cigarettes. Right under the \"No Fumar\" sign (no smoking). Cigarette fumes plus me equals asthma. They show no signs of moving along, they don' speak Spanish and are ignoring the security guard's pleas in Spanish to no fumar.\nNo biggee, not worth hassling with even if I wish they were smoking away from the entrance. It is at times like these that I don my mask before leaving the car. I have a very pretty Vog mask, turquoise blue with hummingbirds and tropical flowers that fits exactly and is the greatest thing ever in my battle to keep breathing.\nPeople tend to look when I put it on, but usually it's just a quick glance. But not today. My eyes are swollen and red due to the palm pollens, and I'm wearing that mask. It's in the pocket of my purse because of the random reactions during the palm blooming season. I'm pretty quickly aware I'm getting not so much curious quick glances. I'm getting downright glares from many of the Americans in the place. I don't know why.\nUntil three sheets to the wind random American with a cart filled with beer and alcohol starts yelling at me. He is convinced I have the Corona Virus and am walking around spreading that shit. Tried to explain it's because of the pulsating crowd of perfumes, cleansers and the lurking smokers. I'm just trying to keep breathing here, buddy.\nAnd so it begins, the American crazy, fear mongering over what you do not understand. Someone wearing a filtration mask is merely trying to stay well.

And yet, after dropping by 9 points yesterday, S&P futures have more than made up those losses and are up 14 points as of Wednesday morning.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said on Wednesday there were 440 cases of the new virus, with nine deaths so far, and added that measures are now in place to minimize public gatherings in the most-affected regions. How one can prevent people from gathering in China, the world's most congested nation, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the outbreak has spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The World Health Organization meets later on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international emergency.\nIn other words, despite what a handful of algos would like to telegraph, the Coronavirus is anything but contained , with the outbreak reviving memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, a coronavirus outbreak that killed nearly 800 people. And the punchline: according to Reuters, \"this time China\u2019s response and candour \u2014 in contrast to the SARS epidemic \u2014 have helped reassure investors concerned about the possible global fallout.\" Actually, the \"response and candour\" confirm, if anything, that China is panicking, but as usual the market is never wrong, until it is.\n\u201cThe call here is not that the virus is done or nipped in the bud by any means,\u201d said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. \u201cBut there have been no big further reported outbreaks, and the response from the Chinese authorities has been very, very positive\u201d.\n\"I would expect a lot of people - candidly, like we are - that are looking for opportunities to buy rather than sell\u201d amid the dip in stocks caused by virus-contagion worries, Lamar Ville re, partner and portfolio manager at Villere & Co., said on Bloomberg TV. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to be the beginning of the end.\u201d\nBecause one obviously \"buys rather then sells\" when stocks are trading at never before seen highs.\nIn any case, optimism that \"Corona is Contained\" helped European stocks in London, Frankfurt and Paris score early gains of 0.1% to 0.2%. European equities first erased initial gains to mirror whiplash price action for stocks in Asia, where early losses reversed after Beijing outlined measures to contain the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, however it has since rebounded again.\nEarlier in the session, Asian stocks resumed their climb, rebounding from the last session led by consumer-staples and technology companies. The benchmark stock gauge recovered about half of Tuesday\u2019s losses, with most markets in the region gaining. Shares in Hong Kong also rebounded, with technology stocks and insurers boosting the Hang Seng Index. Chinese shares erased losses after Beijing said it will start a nationwide screening effort to tackle the outbreak.\nMSCI\u2019s airline industry index .posted its biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. Airline shares were still falling on Wednesday.\n\u201cWhile details on the coronavirus are scant, we reckon that the SARS period could offer some clues as to how markets could pan out,\u201d analysts at Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank said. \u201cThe trends are clear: Yields and stock prices fell in the first few months of the SARS outbreak and rebounded thereafter.\u201d\nAnd yes, the return of Fed-backstopped euphoria means a new record high in the US too where S&P 500 futures just hit a new all time high, reaching Michael Hartnett's target of 3,333 more than one month ahead of schedule (March 3).\nIn rates, US 10Y Treasurys were unchanged with the yield on U.S. 10-year government bonds stabilizing after Tuesday\u2019s drop, sitting at 1.78% US10YT=RR in European trading. Core European and U.K. bond yields are also little changed across most of the curves. Italian government bond yields rose as much as 8 basis points on reports the leader of the country\u2019s 5-Star party and foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, will step down, however they recovered all losses after it was confirmed that he is indeed stepping down. It was the biggest, if brief, sell-off in a month and raised the risk of another snap election in Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy, since 5-Star is part of Italy\u2019s coalition government.\n\u201cThe initial reaction was to sell because of the heightened political uncertainty,\u201d said Luca Cazzulani, a strategist at UniCredit in Milan. \u201cBut there is no outright link between de Maio\u2019s resignation and a collapse of the government.\u201d\nIn FX, with markets generally rising, safe plays such as gold and the Japanese yen were weaker. The dollar was rising toward the highs it reached in December against the other top world currencies.

Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) managed to rebound from opening weakness as outperformance in Consumer Staples, Tech and Healthcare underpinned the Australian benchmark to a fresh all-time high, while Tokyo sentiment was mainly driven by currency moves but with weakness seen in some automakers including Mitsubishi Motors after several of its locations were raided in Germany on suspicion of using emission cheating devices.

Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB (-0.6%) lags its peers with the Italian Banking Index hitting 6-week lows \u2013 on the back of Di Maio\u2019s resignation as the Italian 5SM leader.

In terms of individual movers, Airbus (+1.7%) shares are supported after a source noted that Boeing doesn\u2019t expect regulators to sign off on the 737 Max until June or July, months later than the manufacturer previously expected. Traders also attribute the losses in Tui (-4.3%) to the Boeing news. Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.7%) reversed opening gains on the back of another profit warning in which it expects FY19 results to be below forecasts, with the return on sales of Mercedes-Benz vans also forecast below prior guidance. Meanwhile, ASML (-1.2%) shrugged off a mostly in-line earnings report and a EUR 6bln share buy-back programme, potentially on concerns that the Co. may not completed this programme given that the FY19 share buy-back was incomplete.\nTop European News\nRolet to Step Down as CEO of Billionaire Hintze\u2019s Hedge Fund CQS U.K. Government Spending Soars as Austerity Continues to Thaw ECB Hits Fifth Anniversary of QE Still Puzzled by Inflation Gap Greece\u2019s Lawmakers Elect Country\u2019s First Woman Head of State In FX, although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China\u2019s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday\u2019s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning?\nJPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD - The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday\u2019s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs.

WTI meanders around USD 58/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.57/bbl and the 100 DMA at 57.29, whilst the Brent contract fell below its 100 DMA (62.79/bbl) with eyes on its 200 DMA at 63.97/bbl as Mar\u201920 futures test yesterday\u2019s low just above 64/bbl.

I think 3 miles of that was taking a forced detour as Mr Trump\u2019s motorcade came through town. We hosted a fascinating panel on sustainability pitting NYT best selling author Andrew McAfee who\u2019s written an optimistic tome (More From Less) against Tim Jackson - an ecological economist - who has written a more pessimistic book (Prosperity Without Growth). It made for a lively debate and in all my interactions its clear that the number of these conversations are rising exponentially. In talking about our Davos piece on this topic (link here) at a separate meeting, one client explained one of the dilemmas they face. They invest in African development and mentioned that surely everyone would want health improvements in the continent - especially the poorer parts. However his assertion was that the only way that can happen in the immediate future is if their energy consumption increases which in turn potentially damages the planet. Raising the awareness of such trade-offs is one of the main themes of our report and this is where more and more attention needs to be focused.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that the two headline grabbers of Davos yesterday have different views on the issue. President Trump said that \u201cwe must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse\u201d. It\u2019s fair to say Greta Thunberg took the polar opposite view. Elsewhere in Mr Trump\u2019s speech, he trumpeted the achievements of his administration, criticised the Federal Reserve once again for not cutting rates fast enough, and also said that talks with China on phase two would start \u201cvery shortly\u201d. Later on, ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re going to talk about a big trade deal\u201d and that it was \u201csomething that we all want to be able to make.\u201d However, Trump also said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he was \u201cabsolutely serious\u201d when it comes to putting tariffs on European cars if a trade deal couldn\u2019t be reached.\nIn terms of today at Davos, Von der Leyen will actually be one of the main speakers, with an address at 11:30 CET, while there\u2019s a potentially interesting panel on the future of financial markets a bit earlier at 10:30 CET, which includes IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, along with the US and UK finance ministers, Steven Mnuchin and Sajid Javid.\nBack to markets, and equities sold off yesterday as the US returned from a holiday, with investors becoming a bit more cautious around the world amidst the continued spread of a new coronavirus in China. Reports that a case had been discovered in the US helped reverse a gradual rally back in markets prior to the last couple of hours of US trading. More on the US session below but the latest on the virus is that with the death toll increasing to 9 from 6, China is likely to start nationwide screening as officials are stepping up the monitoring of transportation links in the country. The confirmed cases of the infection have reached 440 as of January 21 (from 218 on January 20) and 1,394 patients are under medical observation. Including the detection in the US, the virus has now stretched to 5 additional countries with Macau reporting its first case overnight. Elsewhere, the WHO is going to decide today as to whether to declare the virus an international public health emergency. China has said that as of now it has seen no evidence of \u201csuper spreaders\u201d - infected people who pass on the disease rapidly to many other people - but could not rule out that some would emerge. Super spreaders played a key role in the SARS pandemic 17 years ago, which killed almost 800 people and hurt economies across the region.\nAssessing the economic impact of the coronavirus, our Asian economists draw conclusions from the past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (link here) and conclude that the impact from any spread of the disease would be felt most in the form of a sharp decline in retail sales, tourism, hotel & catering and travel activities as people try to avoid infection by restricting travel and people to people contact. Also, if necessary, public health measures might get introduced to reduce infections by imposing quarantines and closing schools which could result in a higher impact. But most other services and trade and manufacturing activities are unlikely to be affected much, in their view; and consumption and travel can be expected to recover quickly, even before the authorities give the all clear as observed during the SARS and MERS outbreak. The big problem is that as the Lunar New Year holidays approach it might prove hard for China to contain. Some good news is that China have been forthcoming and transparent about the spread of this coronavirus as they involved the WHO very early on and have also shared the genetic sequencing of the virus to allow early detection of cases in other countries. This is unlike what happened with SARS which first came to light in China in November 2002 but only got widespread attention after the first cases were detected in Hong Kong in February 2003.\nOvernight in Asia, markets are making advances as investors are moderating their concerns over the virus. The Nikkei (+0.59%), Hang Seng (+1.25%) and Kospi (+1.00%) are all up. Meanwhile, the CSI (+0.08%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.02%) are trading flattish. As for Fx, the Japanese yen is down -0.15% while most Asian currencies are making modest advances. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.47% and yields on 10y USTs are up +1.2bps while, gold is trading down -0.33% and oil prices are down -0.40%. As for overnight data releases, South Korea\u2019s preliminary 4Q GDP printed at +2.2% yoy (vs. +1.9% yoy expected).\nBefore this the S&P 500 fell back from its record high from Friday, ending the session down -0.26%. It was a similar story elsewhere, with the NASDAQ (-0.19%) and the Dow Jones (-0.52%) also seeing declines. Boeing (-3.33%) saw another tough session. Before this in Europe, the STOXX 600 pulled back from its intraday low of -0.99% to close just -0.14% lower. Nevertheless the risk-off sentiment supported sovereign debt, with 10yr Treasuries down -5.7bps to 1.766%, while the 2s10s curve flattened by -2.5bps. Gilt yields fell -1.9bps to their lowest level since October, while bunds (-3.1bps) and OATs (-3.0bps) also saw yields move lower. Italy was the exception, where the spread of BTPs over bunds widened by +4.9bps ahead of lots of political news flow of late and a regional election on Sunday. That said, they\u2019re still holding the 150-170bps range seen since mid-November so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if political risk leads to a break out.\nLooking at yesterday\u2019s earnings, UBS shares fell -4.53% after the company reported that last year\u2019s net profit attributable to shareholders was down -5% year-on-year, with the bank also lowering their targets moving forward. Bank stocks were subdued generally yesterday, with the STOXX Banks index closing down -0.47% at a one-month low, though UBS isn\u2019t a member of that particular index.\nStaying with earnings, Netflix reported overnight and said that it added 8.76mn subscribers in 4Q (+20% yoy). However, it forecasted slower subscriber growth in the current quarter at 7mn (vs. 7.82mn) expected. The stock was up +2.38% in afterhours trading. IBM also reported with a slight beat. The stock was up +3.83% after hours.\nOver in FX, sterling was the strongest-performing G10 currency yesterday, as the UK employment numbers ended a run of pretty weak data from the country. The 3m/3m employment change rose to +208k (vs. +110k expected) in November, its highest rate since January, while the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations. In response, investors lowered the odds of a rate cut from the BoE at next week\u2019s meeting after the data release, with the chances falling to around 60%, having been at 70.5% at the close on Friday. Our economists point out (link here) though that most of yesterday\u2019s announced employment gains have been government led so it shouldn\u2019t change the view on a necessary rate cut too much. The last big data release before the BoE meeting will be the preliminary January PMIs on Friday, so the market will be paying close attention.\nMeanwhile in Germany, the ZEW Survey beat expectations, with the current situation reading rising to -9.5 (vs. -13.5 expected), while the expectations reading rose to 26.7 (vs. 15.0 expected), the strongest reading for the expectations indicator since July 2015. So a note of optimism ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ECB meeting.\nIn terms of the day ahead there are a number of key highlights. From central banks, the Bank of Canada will be deciding on rates, while Bank of England Governor Carney will be speaking at the Bloomberg Climate Forum in Davos. Earnings releases out today include Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, ASML and Texas Instruments. Finally on the data, we\u2019ll get French business confidence in January, Italian industrial sales and industrial orders from November, UK public sector net borrowing for December, Canada\u2019s December CPI reading, and finally US existing home sales for December and the FHFA house price index for November.\n", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Market Anxiety Cools"], "gensraw_title": [[27471, 48277, 328, 10142]], "probs_title": [[0.020280970260500908, 0.015435325913131237, 0.0017168741906061769, 0.5642213225364685]]}

We wanted to give you a briefer on what is going on and if you should be concerned. The virus that is being discussed is called 2019-nCoV. It is one of seven known variants of the Coronavirus, which was discovered in the 1960s and is one of the many types of viruses that can cause the common cold, other types being rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza and RSV. Coronavirus gets its name from how the virus looks under a microscope, it looks sort of like a crown. The 2019-nCoV name comes from the date it was discovered (2019), n stands for Novel or \u201cnew\u201d, Co stands for Coronavirus, and V stands for Variant. There are seven variants of the Coronavirus, four of which are commonly known to cause Upper Respiratory Illnesses (URI) and three of which are not commonly associated with URI symptoms. These 3 are some you may have recently heard about: MERS, SARS, and now 2019-nCoV. Coronavirus is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is a virus that typically starts in animals (the \u201chost\u201d) and can then be transmitted to humans. 2019-nCoV was first reported in the Wuhan City, Hubea Province, China. There have been less than 100 cases reported worldwide but there have been at least 2 confirmed deaths and cases reported in 3 countries: China, Japan , and Thailand . The two cases in Japan and Thailand stemmed from travelers who had been in Wuhan City. Most of the cases seem to be linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan City, but some of the cases have not been to this market, suggesting there is some human to human transmission. The two cases that involved deaths were from pneumonia that developed from the 2019-nCoV. Chinese health officials have shared the full genome sequence (DNA) with the National Institute of Health (NIH) so that it can be put in the GenBank, which is a database that allows scientists from around the globe to study different viruses. The CDC began screening passengers from Wuhan City on January 17, 2020, at the 3 major airports that receive travelers from this region of China. Should you be concerned: As it stands, this is a very small outbreak and is concentrated to a single meat market in a single city in China, so unless you are visiting this meat market in China you shouldn\u2019t be concerned. In the bigger picture, though, we need to monitor situations like this as it shows how new viruses can seemingly pop up out of nowhere and start causing problems. If and when we get an easily transmissible and highly lethal strain of the virus, such as what happened with the Influenza Pandemic in 1918-1919, then we should be concerned and this is why the CDC and WHO continue to monitor cases like this.\n", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Virus names Coronavirus: 9 things you should know"], "gensraw_title": [[54, 19398, 3892, 2745, 262, 616, 19398, 26, 861, 1244, 346, 816, 761, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.023148518055677414, 0.5822343826293945, 0.002199027920141816, 0.006947611924260855, 0.9946080446243286, 0.9980260133743286, 0.9913641214370728, 0.12558889389038086, 0.0003127800009679049, 0.8244196176528931, 0.6456220746040344, 0.3665039837360382, 0.9913365840911865, 0.49567610025405884]]}

Convalescent plasma therapy involves taking plasma donated by someone who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing it into a hospitalized patient currently battling a serious COVID-19 infection. Robert Riordan being treated with experimental convalescent plasma therapy Scripps Health supplied KUSI News with the following press release detailing the treatment: SAN DIEGO (April 24, 2020) \u2014 Scripps Health recently became the first health care provider in San Diego County to use an experimental therapy as a possible treatment for COVID-19 patients. The treatment involves taking plasma donated by someone who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing it into a hospitalized patient currently battling a serious COVID-19 infection. The idea behind the treatment \u2013 known as convalescent plasma therapy \u2013 is that people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their plasma that can attack the virus when transfused into patients with serious, active disease. On April 22, Encinitas resident Robert Riordan came to the Scripps Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Scripps Green Hospital to donate plasma. Riordan was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 19 after a ski trip to Colorado. He has been symptom-free since March 27. Riordan is the second person who came to Scripps to donate convalescent plasma, which will be transfused into a patient being treated in the intensive care unit at Scripps Green. The first convalescent plasma collection and transfusion took place at Scripps Green with a different donor and patient on April 1. While the therapy is still experimental, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 24 allowed doctors to use plasma from recovered patients to treat those with \u201cserious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections\u201d under an emergency approval system. Doctors can apply to the FDA to use it for their patients, and the agency will review the requests quickly and make decisions on a case by case basis. The first convalescent plasma treatments in the U.S. for COVID-19 were performed in late March in New York and Texas, and other centers throughout the country are now adopting the therapy. Doctors and researchers will be monitoring progress closely, as they know it will take time to determine how well convalescent plasma works against COVID-19. Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Society described convalescent plasma treatment administered to five critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Shenzhen, China. The patients recovered to varying degrees after their treatments, and while the study was small and only observational, it raises the possibility that convalescent plasma therapy may be helpful in treating this patient population. The strategy of transfusing convalescent plasma has been used in the past to treat viral disease outbreaks of polio, measles, and mumps before a vaccine was available. More recently it\u2019s has been used with some effectiveness to treat patients with SARS and Ebola. During an evolving pandemic like COVID-19, plasma-based treatments can provide a critical stopgap while therapies and vaccines are being developed. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid that remains after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood. For more information on convalescent plasma donation, call 858-554-4340.

People will not even give any courtesy driving now during good times. Imagine when it gets bad.\nEven still, it is hard to imagine this scenario. Weather is nice, sales are good, and people are over the scare from last weekend. back to anarchy as usual.\nMeanwhile a Chinese cruise ship docked and had around 700 people walk around Manila, then it ended up quarantine a few days later.

The ministry is involved in monitoring the supply of essential items during the nationwide lockdown.\nThe responsibility of ensuring the supply of pulses from the buffer stocks has been given to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), which is under the administrative control of the Agriculture Ministry.\nThe Finance Ministry stated in a statement on \"Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Progress So Far\" on April 23 stated that \"1,09,227 MT of Pulses have also been dispatched\" to various states and Union Territories (UTs).\nThe Food Ministry&apos;s data, however, revealed that against a monthly allocation of 1,95,531 MT pulses under PMGKAY, to provide pulses free of cost to 19.55 crore families under NFSA, only 1,22,312 MT have been issued to states. The data further shows that out of this, 44,932 MT have been sent to \"destination\" states, 34,768 MT received by these states, and only 19,496 MT distributed to the beneficiaries.\nDespite the announcement of PMGKAY on March 26, a day after PM Modi announced nationwide lockdown to contain novel coronavirus, the apathy in distribution is due to delay in the milling process by NAFED, sources in the Food Ministry have informed.\n\"We have to distribute free pulses to 19.55 crore families for three months across all 36 states and UTs. In big states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the number of eligible beneficiaries is quite high and, therefore, the allocation is high, (so) we are taking some time,\" a senior official of NAFED was Quote: d as saying. He added that NAFED is sending pulses to these states.\nAccording to the official pulses have been dispatched to UTs such as Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Puducherry and Chandigarh, and smaller states such as Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura. \"Buffer stock of pulses is always kept un-milled (whole), and the milling process takes some time,\" the official further said.\nThe central nodal agency for procurement of notified agricultural commodities, including pulses, NAFED is under the Price Support Scheme run by the Agriculture Ministry.\nThe agency also maintains a buffer stock of pulses under the Price Stabilisation Fund Scheme administered by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.\nEarlier the Food Ministry officials had flagged a slow response in the supply of pulses to the states. The Cabinet Secretary is learnt to have directed the concerned officials from the Agriculture Ministry and NAFED to speed up supply.\n\"To ensure adequate availability of protein to all the above-mentioned individuals, 1 kg pulses per family would be provided according to regional preferences for the next three months. These pulses would be provided free of cost by the Government of India.,\" the government stated in a statement issued on March 26.", "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_title": ["Nearly One-Month Old Relief Package Provisioned For NPCAS Moved Backward With PMGKAY Dip In Pulses Demand"], "gensraw_title": [[27928, 1882, 13, 31949, 5707, 30324, 15718, 43162, 277, 1115, 15889, 1922, 338, 2669, 5158, 905, 2081, 3123, 39, 43, 4793, 43946, 555, 351, 5754, 275, 34480, 50264]], "probs_title": [[0.03991120681166649, 0.06049489229917526, 0.22981347143650055, 0.3176652789115906, 0.035216908901929855, 0.33691418170928955, 0.7835738062858582, 0.0030329388100653887, 0.1824711412191391, 0.6904141902923584, 0.00021576866856776178, 0.009091935120522976, 0.0030877748504281044, 0.008380154147744179, 0.028481077402830124, 0.06430623680353165, 0.009759945794939995, 0.008083553984761238, 0.7864117622375488, 0.9680631756782532, 0.983173668384552, 7.157770596677437e-05, 0.525390088558197, 0.2041238248348236, 0.9993371367454529, 0.9923256635665894, 0.0437161922454834, 0.9535244107246399]]}
